Metaphors and related notions
	My experience in the metaphor course, and in the year since then, has been somewhat disconcerting. The notion of metaphor was, and still is, very elusive for me. I found it hard to define, or even pin down in a satisfactory way. So my first goal in this paper will be to elucidate some features and dimensions of metaphor. In this enterprise I will find it helpful to compare and contrast metaphors with the related notions of models, similes, analogies, symbols, and names. These concepts all seem to be very interrelated, hence the distinctions between them are often fuzzy. Because of this I find it useful to think of these concepts as lying at various points along a continuum. Actually there is no single continuum, but rather a number of continua along a variety of more or less independent dimensions. Rather than try to deal at once with the many facets of each of these concepts, I will see how each concept relates to the others along one dimension at a time.
	Before I launch into the enterprise of discussing how these concepts differ along various diminsions, I would like to outline the framework within which I see them all as being similar. What is involved in each instance is a pair of cognitive structures or representations which are interrelated by some form of mapping, and certain processes which act on these representations.
	In the case of metaphor one often sees the form "X is a Y" where X is not literally a Y, e.g. "The moon is a lantern above the clouds." Here the two structures being related are the conceptual frames for moon and lantern. The mapping consists of imposing one structure on the other. The processing can be either recognition and interpretation, or generation.
	In the case of modelling, the two structures are the model and that which is modelled. The mapping consists of some form of isomorphism between features of the model and features of that which is modelled. The processes involved can be those of creating a model, or employing a model for predictive purposes.
	With simile the two structures are compared using "as" or "like" at the surface linguistic level, e.g. "quick as lightning", "meek as a lamb", or "soft like fur". The mapping consists of comparing and/or carrying over properties or features of one description to properties or features of the other. The processing can again be either of a productive, generating sort, or of an interpretive, understanding nature.
	In an analogy, two related structures are employed to shed light on one another, or one is used as a vehicle for understanding the other. An example of a mathematical analogy is noticing the similarity of the theorems that the angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent and that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle are concurrent. Knowing a proof of one of the theorems, it is possible to discover a proof for the other by carrying over the essential ideas or structure of the first proof. The mapping consists of a partial isomorphism of the two structures, including elements, relations, and steps of the proof. The processing of this sort of analogy consists of both recognizing the appropriateness of the analogy, that is, the similarity of the structure in the two situations, and working with and extending further the correspondence. For example, extending the isomorphism of the statements of the theorems to an isomorphism of the proofs is one kind of processing that might occur.
	I will tend to lump symbols and names into one category. Here we have a structure for a symbol and one for the thing symbolized (or,equivalently, a name and a referent). As a rule, the mapping is little more than a single associative link, but sometimes a name or symbol shares some features or structure with that which it names or symbolizes. Consider, for example, words like "buzz" or "hum", and symbols such as the lamb in Christianity or the yin-yang symbol of Taoism. In the case of the lamb, structural features shared with Christ are meekness of manner, and the aspect of being sacrificed. The yin-yang symbol abstractly represents the union or interpenetration of opposites. The processessing, in the case when the two representations are not structurally related, consists merely of creating or recognizing an associative link between the two. Often this is the case even when the symbol has some underlying significance. The deeper meaning may not come to conscious attention except when explicitly called for.

What are their purposes? What are they used for?
	Metaphor and simile both serve a primarily descriptive function. Through their use it is possible to describe things in a rich and economical fashion. It is furthermore possible to focus attention on new aspects of that which is being described, so as to cause it to be thought about in a different manner, or to be looked upon from a novel viewpoint. Because of this they also play a role in aiding creativity. Seeing something from a new perspective, or with a novel description, can be extremely suggestive of new ideas.
	Analogy is rather more important for understanding, and less primarily descriptive in nature. It enables one to deal with a novel or complex situation by analogy with a more familiar or straightforward one. The more familiar situation can serve as a framework for organizing the features of the complex situation, hence reducing the overall information-processing burden imposed on the system by the complexity it is confronted with. Analogies are even more important than similes for their suggestiveness. Their use can lead in many cases to a deeper understanding of the situation at hand. The mapping between the familiar and complex structures can suggest new ways of viewing the features and organization of each.
	Models are used primarily for prediction and understanding, with less emphasis on description than was the case with metaphors and similes. As with analogies, models are important for understanding. They, too, can be very suggestive of new ways to look at things, altered focus of attention, or new experiments that one might try. Models also serve an organizational purpose in uniting bodies of observed facts in a reasonably economical way.
	Symbols and names serve a primarily denotative or referential role. Thus, in a restricted sense they are somewhat descriptive. They are not very important for understanding or creativity in any direct sense. They are quite important from the standpoint of economy, however. The name or symbol is, as a rule, quite simple, but may refer to a structure or entity which is quite complex. Hence their primary usefulness is for ease of reference and economy of representation.

Similarity of the two structures
	One of the dimensions along which metaphor can be contrasted with the related concepts is that of the similarity of the two structures being processed. One extreme is where there is virtually no similarity at all between the two. This occurs in the case of names and symbols. They are typically abstract verbal or visual labels used to refer to something else, and having little intrinsically in common with that something else other than the single associative link.
	In the case of the other concepts there is much more common structure, or shared properties, between the two things being related. In the case of models and analogies this common underlying structure is usually quite extensive. With models, especially, there is an explicit isomorphism between elements of the model and elements of the domain being modelled. Furthermore, this isomorphism extends to a correspondence of interactions among model elements with interactions among corresponding elements of the reality being modelled.
	With metaphors and similes there is a greater variability in the degree of common structure of the two representations in question. Similes, as a rule, do not tend to be extremely elaborate. Often the common structure consists of a single feature as in the expression "X is light as a feather". Metaphors are generally more elaborate than this. As an example consider the metaphor "romantic triangle" for a situation where B and C both love A. This is not literally a triangle yet it shares certain features and common structure with a triangle.

Relative concreteness or familiarity of the two representational structures
	At one end of this dimension we have the case of one structural representation being much more familiar or concrete than the other. At the other end the two representations are equal in this regard. An example of the latter case is the type of analogy problems common in intelligence tests. Analogies can also be at the other end of the spectrum as in the case of following a complicated mathematical proof by analogy to a simpler, more familiar proof of a similar result. Thus analogies, at least, appear to be independent of this particular dimension.
	The remaining concepts seem to share the feature that one of the representational structures is more familiar or concrete. This familiarity or immediateness partially accounts for the vividness of description that is achievable through metaphors and similes. With models the fact that the model is easier to manipulate than that which it models accounts for the power of the modelling process.
	Symbols and names do not lie at a particular point along the dimension of relative concreteness. Although the symbol or name is generally very concrete (either visually or auditorially), that which it symbolises can vary greatly in degree of concreteness, hence the relative concreteness has great variability.

Conventionality
	Still another dimension along which comparison can be made is that of conventionality versus novelty. Symbols and names, by their very nature, lie at the extreme conventional end of this spectrum. Their interpretation must necessarily be standardized in order that they may serve their referential function in communication.
	Models also exhibit a tendency to be conventional, nevertheless here there is greater variability than with symbols and names. There are common or standard models in most cases, yet sometimes there are novel or unconventional models. These latter often arise during periods of paradigm shifts in science.
	Metaphors, similes, and analogies display much greater variability. They may be found at all points along the conventionality-novelty continuum. At the conventional end we have the "dead" metaphors which have been assimilated into the language and culture and cease to evoke much reaction. For example, common phrases like "things are looking up", "getting around a difficulty", "driving a point home", "beating a dead horse", etc. The last example almost never evokes any horse or beating images for me. Such examples have become idioms, and as such are highly conventional. There are conventional or cliche similes such as "quiet as a mouse", "innocent as a babe", "ferocious as a tiger", etc. Simple analogies also tend to be conventional (they also tend to be indistinguishable from similes), e.g. "Trying to conveince him is like hitting your head against a brick wall."
	The novel metaphors and similes are the more interesting. It is also harder to generate good examples of these, but I'll make an attempt to find a few. Take, for instance, the phrase "massaging data" which still has a novel effect on me. It evokes concrete images of manual manipulation, of applying pressure but not causing drastic change of form.
	Another example is the "spaceship Earth" metaphor from ecology. This causes me to restructure my view of our planet in a number of ways. First it leads me to view the Earth as small and limited rather than vast and expansive. Secondly it emphasizes the view of a planet as a closed system, hence the need for conservation and recycling of resources and materials. The people of the Earth get mapped into passengers of a spaceship, and must assume responsibility for management of available resources, just as the spaceship personnel must conserve food and oxygen.

Kinds of mapping
	Still another dimension for comparison is that of the mapping between the two representational structures. In the case of names and symbols we have a rather degenrate mapping consisting primarily of a single associative link. There are generally no shared features between the set of phonemes comprising a word and that object or representation which the word refers to.
	A slightly more interesting kind of mapping is one in which one or more features are common to each of the two representational structures. This occurs often in similes and a restricted class of metaphors. Take, for instance, the phrase "her fleece was white as snow" from the familiar nursery rhyme. Here the mapping consists primarily of a correspondence between the color of the fleece of Mary's lamb and the color of snow, white in each case. There is some additional association of secondary features such as softness and fluffiness, but there is little, if any, shared relational structure.
	The most extensive version of mapping is what I call a structural isomorphism. By this I mean a mapping which not only associates elements and features of the two representational structures, but also associates relations holding among elements. The relations are associated in such a way that if a relation holds between two elements in one structure then a corresponding relation holds between the corresponding elements of the second structure. Formally, if M is a mapping from structure S1 to structure S2 and the relation aRb holds in S1, then M(a)M(R)M(b) holds as a relation in S2. We can distinguish between a complete structural isomorphism in which all the elements and relations have their unique counterparts in the other structure, and the more common partial structural isomorphism in which the isomorphism is between substructures of the representational structures under consideration.
	Partial structural isomorphisms often exist in metaphors, and are nearly always present in the case of models and analogies. They are immensely important since they serve to focus attention on partiuclar elements and relations of a representation. If a partial isomorphism is created between a given structure and certain less salient portions of a second structure, this may have the effect of restructuring the second representation by altering ones judgements as to which are the prominent or important relations and features.
	Consider, for example, the following metaphor: "The U.S. was a childish bully in Viet Nam." For me, this induces a structural isomorphism as diagrammed in fig. 1.
.FIGURE 16
	The structural similarity can lead to identification of all or part of the respective structures in the case of metaphors. I call this merging of structures. In the case of the last example one might obtain the merged structure of fig. 2.
.FIGURE 16
	This example metaphor tends to focus attention on the victim in the case of the U.S. in Viet Nam. A different metaphor, e.g. "The U.S. was a big brother helping out his little brother in Viet Nam", would focus attention on the U.S. in its relation to South Viet Nam and emphasize the notions of defense, aid, support, and so on. Thus different metaphors can serve to highlight different sets of features and relations, hence resulting in different ways of viewing or thinking about the same situation.
	The "love triangle" example is yet another illustration of structural isomorphism. The three persons involved correspond to the three vertices of a geometric triangle and the relationships between the pairs of people correspond to edges connecting pairs of vertices (see fig. 3).
.FIGURE 16
	Notice that the relational structure is preserved in the correspondence. Persons A and B correspond to vertices A and B respectively. The relationship lover-of between A and B corresponds to the edge c in the triangle which joins vertices A and B.

Degree of merging versus separation of representational structures
	The various concepts also differ in the defree to which the two structures are merged to form a single composite structure. It is primarily in the case of metaphor that a merged structure is created, as in the "U.S. was a bully in Viet Nam" example. In the cases of simile, analogy, models, and naming, the two structures involved are kept relatively distinct. Metaphors are unique in that they impose the one structure on the other, forming a composite structure.
	I believe this occurs as follows. The understanding system first attempts to treat statements literally. Since metaphoric statements are often of the form A is a B (e.g. "His brother is an elephant"), the system first tries to form a structure in which the statement is literally true. In the case of a metaphor this leads to a contradiction. This then requires the system to go into non-literal or metaphoric mode, in which the statement is treated figuratively or metaphorically. In non-literal mode the system will tolerate greater deformation or restructuring of the representation, hence allowing it to make sense of the statement by creating a single merged structure.
