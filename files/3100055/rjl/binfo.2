Information about this version of BASIC:

This is a temporary document about this BASIC,
which replaces the previous super temporary BASIC.

To restart this version, start at 300 (i.e. 300G)
To restart clearing the program, start at 304
To quit out of an infinite loop, type <control>G.

To save a program on a casstte, use the SAVE command.
It will tell you to start the casstte and then
type <CR>. After you type CR BASIC will wait a few
seconds, which will give you a chance to change
the recording speed. When the program is saved,
stop the cassette, change the speed back and type
<CR>. BASIC should respond with READY.

To load the program from a tape, type the BASIC command NEW,
set the speed to the speed the tape was recorded at and start
the tape. When the tape is done, reset the speed. BASIC
should be ready.

The LOGO line editing commands also work in BASIC. Immediately
after typing a line you can edit it, or you can edit a line
while typing it in. <rubout> rubs out the last
character <control>W rubs out the last word. <control>N
gets the next word from the previous line, <control>R
gets the rest of the previous line. For more information,
see the LOGO documentation.
