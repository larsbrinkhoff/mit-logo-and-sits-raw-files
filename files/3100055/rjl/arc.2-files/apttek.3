Half of a duplex in Brookline, 4 miles from MIT, will become available on Sept 1st.
The apartment
is in excellent condition in a fairly new buliding, has 3 bedrooms,
a large living room/dining room combination, and a reasonable size kitchen.
It is a 5 minute walk to the Brookline Hills MBTA stop.
The neighborhood is nice, the apartment sunny (good for plant freaks).
There is a driveway and garage (room for 2 cars), and a moderate
size back yard.
.br
$370/month, unheated.
