Dear Prentice:

	This letter is to confirm our phone conversation of 14 April.

	In previous phone conversations we discussed the fact that the
200 TPI drive you have supplied us is not operating very well, and the
fact that you have not delivered the 2nd 200TPI drive which we ordered
more than a year ago on our purchase order number PM 19309, 16 March 1975.
That purchase order was made in response to a (written) quote
from Phil Martineau, in which he offered to provide two (2) 200TPI
drives at $5000 each, and give a trade in of $3000 for our 100TPI
drive. He quoted approximately 90 days delivery on the 2 drives.

	So far, you have delivered one of the 200TPI drives, and we
have sent our 100TPI drive back to you. We have also paid an
invoice for $5000 on 25 July 1975, and have recieved no compensation for the
trade-in drive. As mentioned above, the 200TPI drive is
not satisfactory.

	In phone conversations in March 1976, you promised that you would,
by 15 April 1976, either:
	1) provide us with 2 200TPI drives from a different
	manufacturer than Wangco (the manufactuer of the
	unreliable drive we have now)

	2) return the trade-in 100TPI drive and the $5000 we have
	paid you.
You also promised to send a letter confirming this, which you never
did.

	Starting around the end of March, I began calling you almost
every day, in an attempt to find out when we would recieve the confirming
letter, and what the likelihood of the 1st or 2nd alternative was.
When I finally contacted you on 14 April, you told me that you might
be able to fullfill alternative 1 by about the 1st of May. I told you
that that was not satisfactory, since the delays we had already
encountered had had serious effects on our work here, and that
we would rather take alternative 2 so that we would be free to
deal with another supplier. You agreed to fullfil alternative 2,
and promised that our $5000 would be returned sometime shortly
after 1 May, 1976. You would also arrange to return our 100TPI
drive, and we would then return your 200TPI drive. You said you
would send a letter confirming this.

	My understanding of the sitituation now is that we can
expect you to return our $5000 sometime very soon after 1 May, and
that also fairly soon we would effect the reverse trade of the
100TPI and 200TPI drives. I expect your letter confirming this to
arrive momentarily.

					Sincerely,


					Ron Lebel
