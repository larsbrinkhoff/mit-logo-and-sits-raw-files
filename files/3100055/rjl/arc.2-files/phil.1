Phil:
	It is important that I get in touch with you very soon. Since
you are never at the restaurant when I tell them who's calling, I'm leaving
you this note.
	It is currently my understanding that since you have not paid
the May rent you intend to move out before 1 June 75 and have the
security deposit apllied to the rent you owe.
	According to the sub-tenancy agreement you signed, the lease it
refered to, and our mutual understanding (which the broker can and will
attest to) you have rented this place until the end of August. Since
you have not paid the May rent, you are now in default of $250. If noone
pays the June rent you will be in default of $500. If you don't pay
this, I will have to, at least until I take you to court. It will
certainly be to our mutual advantage to find a tenant to pay the June
rent, in which case your security deposit will take care of the May
rent. After the matter of the damage to the door is settled, there
almost certainly will be something left of the remaining $125;
in fact, if we don't have to pay a broker's fee and can convince
the landlord to absorb the damage to the door, the entire $125
will be available, and will legally belong to you. However, if no
tenant can be found for June, or if you continue occuping the apartment
past the end of June, you will be legally responsible for the $250
June rent, which, not counting the door, means that you'll be $125
dollars behind. Since I don't intend to sustain that loss myself,
it will have to come out of your pocket.
	I think you'll agree that it will be to your advantage
to find a tenant for June. I am willing to help you find a tenant,
but I can't do that very well if I don't even know when you're
going to get your stuff out. If we don't find a tenant, I'm
going to have to chase after you for the money, and I don't
want to have to do that, so I want to help find a tenant.
	Please get in touch with me as soon as you get this.
My home phone is 731-4831, my phone numbers at work are 253-6765
and 253-3473.

					Sincerely,




					Ron Lebel
