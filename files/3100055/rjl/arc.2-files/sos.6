Son of SITS
.sp
	Several months ago I began joint a project with Societe Generale Tortue
Ltee (succesor to the original General Turtle), with the blessing of Seymour,
to develop a stand alone LOGO system, sometimes known as the 3500. This
paper is a report on that now almost complete project and the reasons
why I feel it is important.
.sp
The impact
.sp
	Let me begin by saying that I believe that the development
of the 3500 is the single most important thing to happen in the
last few years to affect the future possibilities of funding
for the LOGO project at MIT. We have been repeatedly critisized,
I think justly, that LOGO, both as a language system and as
a curiculum, has not been available outside of MIT. Even
if this were not true we can hardly expect to sustain interest
in LOGO if we are not able to distribute it. While it might be
true that various PDP10 versions of LOGO were available and
that SITS LOGO might have been distributed the 3500 is by
far the most economical way to begin a small LOGO project
in a school which does not already have access to a PDP10 or
a PDP11.
	One example of this is the BOCES project in New York,
where Kathy O'Brien is using two 3500's working with handicapped
children. With a rather small investment she has two terminals
with display capability running LOGO in an evironment with no
other computers, no system programmmers and no hardware hackers.
The only hardware and software support she has is that provided
as a standard product by Tortue.
	Another example is the two 3500's running in Darmstat, Germany.
In this case the people involved are more able to deal with
problems of hardware and software but are doing very well very
far away from any assitance.
	My last example is the discussions I have been having
with Dan Watt about the econmics of placing computer terminals
in each of 8 schools in Brookline. Without going into great detail,
our investigations seem to indicate that Brookline can rent
8 of the smallest systems from Tortue for about half of
the cost of rented terminals, phone lines and compter time
on a PDP10.
	At this point Torue has sold about 15 3500 systems,
only 2 or 3 of which have been to colleges, the rest going
mainly to high school level institutions. As the number of
systems increases presumably the interest in LOGO will
increase, benfiting both us and Tortue.

Usefullness to us
.sp
	While the main intention in developing the 3500 was to
provide a system which could be distributed outside of MIT it is
also true that the 3500 is very interesting for our work here
and in schools. In particular, the cost of running high bandwidth
displays at a remote location is prohibitive; the 3500 will
allow high performance graphics to be brought into schools for
our experiments. Mulitiple 3500's also provide higher
reliability and better response time than possible
with a single timesharing system. For these reasons 3500s
have been included in several of the recently subbmitted
LOGO proposals.
.sp
What is a 3500?
.sp
	The name 3500 was obtained by adding 1000 to 2500, based on the
original idea that a standalone LOGO system could be obtained by
improvments to the 2500 display terminal which Marvin and others had developed.
This approach was not taken for several reasons, the most important
being that rewriting LOGO for another processor would be a rather
large task. With the availability from DEC of the LSI-11 processor
it seemed that the most efficient method for obtaining a standalone
LOGO would be to use that processor for running the PDP11 LOGO code
which had been developed to run under the SITS timesharing system.
Thus, what is now known as a 3500 is a combination of an LSI-11
and a 2500 display.
	The 3500 is available from Tortue in a variety of configurations:
the smallest consists of an LSI-11 with 28K of memory, floating point hardware,
a digital cassette system and a terminal (either a DEC LA36 printing terminal
or a DEC VT52 display terminal). The largest configuration has an LSI-11
with floating point, 30K of memory, floppy disk file storage, 60CPS
printer and a 2500 display terminal. The price range of these systems
are from $9K to $16K.
.sp
Software development
.sp
	While it is true that the LOGO which runs on the 3500
is essentially the same as the LOGO which runs under SITS on
the PDP11/45, the differences between the two processors and
the two environments (timesharing vs standalone) were sufficient
to require considerable software development. This work was
begun by Gary Dresher, who wrote an 11/45 floating point
emulator for the LSI-11 and also wrote a SITS emulator
to do the teletype operations on the LSI-11 that were
performed by SITS on the 11/45. He also made modifications
to LOGO to reorganize storage alocation to conform with
what was possible on the LSI-11. All of the these changes,
and all subsequent changes were made in a way which was
compatable with the SITS version of LOGO; the same source
code can be assembled as a version for SITS or a version
for the LSI-11 depending on the setting of an assembly flag.
All of the code was debugged using a modification of DDT
on SITS, done by Bruce Edwards, which allowed debugging
code running on the LSI-11 with a symbolic debugger
running under SITS.
	The remaining software work was mostly done by me.
The major part of this was adding to the SITS emulator
the system calls to support file operations on the
floppy disk and the 60CPS lineprinter. It was also nessesary
to write a number of disk utility programs to handle
loading and dumping of binary programs and general
disk maintence.
	The result of this software development is that the LOGO
avaiable on the LSI-11 has all of the power of the one
available on SITS. The filing system available on the floppy
disk is identical to the one on SITS except for the fact
that that there is less storage on the floppy disk than
on the SITS disks and the floppy disks can be changed
while the system is running (thus giving infinite off-line
storage capability). The working storage available to users of
the LSI-11 is not as large as that available on the 11/45,
but future hardware and software developments might
fix this.
.sp
Hardware development
.sp
	The hardware development for the 3500 can be divided
into that done to the 2500 and that for the LSI-11. The main
problem with the 2500 was that its font memory and control
memory were volatile and therefore had to be reloaded
(at least) every time power was turned on. In practice
loading was occasionally required when the machine
got "zapped" also. Since the 2500 was going to serve
as the terminal for the system it was unacceptable to
have to worry about loading a program into it; therefore
the font memory and control memory were replaced by PROMs.
Brian Silverman did the software work needed for this conversion
to PROMs.
	The development for the LSI-11 was mostly concentrated
on replacing things which, although available from DEC, were
unacceptably expensive. It is also true that reliable delivery
cannot always be obtained from DEC; it is the goal of Tortue
to buy only the LSI-11 processor from DEC. To achieve this goal,
which was percieved as nessesary to bringing the price of
the system within reach of more schools, several subprojects
were executed. The cabient and power supplies were the simplest;
the cabients and power supplies used for the 2500 were adapted
for use witht the LSI-11. Memory for the LSI-11 was purchased
from independant vendors; currently National Semiconductor
and Monolithic Systems Inc are providing plug-in memory boards
to Tortue. The floppy disk system is a hybrid consisting of
disk drives purchased from General Systems International,
a controller purchased from Scientific Micro Systems and
an interface designed by me. The DEC serial interface
has also been replaced by one of my design.
.sp
Future plans
.sp
	The software developed for this project will, with fairly
small modifications, run on a large number of existing PDP11
configurations. It is planned to make the changes to support
the standard DEC floppy disk system and one on the most
popular DEC hard disks. The existance of this software will
probably be published in some as yet undertermined fashion.
When sufficient documentation exists the system will
be offered to DECUS for distribution.
.sp
Whose fault is it?
.sp
	The responisbility for the development of the 3500 is
quite spread around. Of course all of the previous work on PDP11
LOGO contributed to it, as did all of the previous work in
developing the 2500 and in creating General Turtle.
The idea of creating the 3500 by running LOGO on the LSI-11
was originally mine, but only gradually received support.
The project was actually begun when Guy Montpetit asked
me to help with it. It would have been impossible for the
LOGO project to have developed the 3500 without the support
of the staff at Tortue which greatly aided in the hardware development.
