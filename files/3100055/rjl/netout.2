December 13, 1977

A concerted effort is being made to improve the general state of CSD
computing by (1) making more general purpose computing available; (2)
improving access to computing with better terminals and communications;
and (3) creating special purpose facilities as necessary.  Here is a
rundown of the current status of several facility items.


1.  DEPARTMENT COMPUTER.  The department in conjunction with DSL and the

 Circuit's Lab of EE submitted a proposal to NSF for $150,000
toward getting a DEC System 20/40 plus some color displays and a color
plotter.  The grant will be judged by May or June.  To fund a
configuration of the size requested, we will need at least another
$300,000.  We expect some funding from EE.  We will approach foundations
for the rest.  

2.  AI LAB S1.  Livermore Labs has funded the development of the S1, a
powerful multiprocessor designed by Stanford students Curt Widdoes and Tom
McWilliams.  The AI Lab has proposed to Livermore to write an S1 operating
system.  If the proposal is approved, one S1 processor with memory will go
to the AI project on extended loan.  The proposal will be judged within
weeks.  If approved, it would mean a commitment of Lab personnel to the
project but little extra equipment cost.  A usable system would be several
years away.  It is not known how access would be alloted.

3.  SYSTEMS LABORATORY.  The department and DSL have asked Hewlett-
Packard for six of its new Amigo personal computers plus peripherals.
These should be configured in a small network, as a "systems laboratory"
for distributed computing research and advanced systems course projects.
There is a possibility of joint development with Hewlett-Packard of Amigo
software, such as a multi-user operating system or a one-user Lisp.  A
decision on complete or partial funding is expected in a couple of months.

4.  TERMINAL SYSTEM ON CAMPUS.  Ted Panofsky at the AI Lab has worked on
the design of a new terminal system for the Lab.  Very little has been
done to extend this or come up with an alternative for a department-wide
terminal system.  Jeff Barth has tentatively explored a microprocessor
based system from Zilog as the foundation of a smart terminal, and a
cheaper but equivalent replacement for Datamedias has been discussed but
not acted upon.  No funding souces have been identified.

5.  DEPARTMENT NETWORK.  A network to link major existing department
computers and a future terminal system has been discussed, but we are far
from design work.  Some commercial and university alternatives, such as
the MIT network. should be evaluated for possible adaptation to our
situation.  No funding sources have been identified.

6.  OTHER FACILITIES.  Talks with Xerox are stalled awaiting a Xerox
corporate policy on making equipment available to unversities.  We are
interested in Altos and successor personal computers, network equipment,
and advanced xerographic printers.  Professor Knuth is evaluating computer

IMSSS is also investigating book preparation aided by computers.  No other
equipment or software projects are currently planned.
