2500 possible changes & isssues

XCOR, YCOR, HEADING
	A self flushing command will send back the current
	X, Y and angle. I think we will depend upon the
	good will of the host to wait for the result before sending
	more commands, so that the self-flush feature
	will be easy. This also means rewriting the output
	side transmission line stuff to provide a real
	output buffer instead of the current 1 character
	one. There is a problem about how many
	stratch pads this will take. There is also the
	problem of encoding the returned data; I propose that
	the data be preceeded by a character which cannot normally
	be generated by the 2500 keyboard (are there any of these?)
	I guess there will follow about 9 characters with 5
	significant bits each?

Danny's turtle
	I think that the turtle interface should be a plug in
	card rather than built in to every 2500 that exists.
	This may imply that it should have a different device
	number than it does currently, but other than that should
	have no effect on the code. Does anyone know of any problems
	with the turtle code that should be straightened out
	before it gets fried into ROM?

snaps & animation
	Sigh. This needs to be hashed out.

plotter
	This is easy but hard. A command will cause the 2500 to
	stop displaying, with the DAC's at zero volts. Then the
	user turns on the plotter and centers it. How do we control
	the pen? Anyway, then the display program has to run in slow
	motion; I think the thing to do is jump to a display loop
	which calls chekints while counting down a constant. Since this
	loop will be over 1 microsec we can get delays of up to about
	.1 sec this way with just one level of loop. When done,
	the program waits for a command to turn the display back
	on, while the user turns the plotter off.

music
	Let's save this one for the next round.

VT52
	I think that this should be done on general principles,
	although the benifits aren't fantastically clear. It will
	mean changing the escape character, but the above changes
	are going to make things incompatible anyway. The VT52
	implementation should be straightforward; we will ignore
	the obscure things like alternate keypad. I guess we
	could use "graphics mode" to access the otherwise inaccessible
	font characters, but maybe it would be best to leave that
	out too.

LSI11 transmit mode
	We should consider putting in a mode to allow 8-bit
	transmission of display commands. While we're at
	it we should figure out if the 2500 will be able to
	recieve at 19.2 kbaud
