Stuff that should be on the SITS0 pack:

RUG dumps itself onto a special place (not in the file system) when
it is first loaded and started. RUG lives in AI:RUG;AR BIN. The way
to load it is with the ITS program STUFF. The PDP11 number to use is 4.

SALV which is AI:SITS;SALV BIN

SITS  which should be AI:SITS;SITS BIN

SYSSPR which is AI:SITS;SYSSPR BIN

SLOGO which should be the purified version of AI:NLOGO;SLOGO BIN
	To purify, load the file with DDT, type PURIFY$G, then dump
	out with $$Y
	Usually it is a good idea to keep an unpurified copy too,
	dumped as LOGO#nnn
	To assemble, do
	:palx nlogo;slogo_@slogo

DDT which should be the purified version of AI:SITS;DDT BIN

INQUIR which is AI:SITS;INQUIR BIN
