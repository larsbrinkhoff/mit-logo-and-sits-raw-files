INTRODUCTION

 THE SITS DDT IS A PROGRAM USED TO DEBUG OTHER PROGRAMS.
IT BEHAVES MUCH LIKE THE DDT ON THE ITS SYSTEM. TO USE DDT, ONE
LOADS AN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAM STORED AS A FILE IN A SPECIAL
FORMAT AS AN "INFERIOR" TO DDT.  ONLY FILES IN ONE OF THE SPECIAL
FORMATS CAN BE LOADED; FILES IN OTHER FORMATS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR.
ONCE LOADED, THE PROGRAM CAN BE RUN IN A CONTROLLED FASHION, STOPPED,
AND LOCATIONS IN THE PROGRAM EXAMINED AND CHANGED.
     COMMANDS TO DDT COME IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT VARIETIES. PERHAPS
THE SIMPLEST ARE THE COLON COMMANDS, EXECUTED BY TYPING A COLON
FOLLOWED BY THE NAME OF THE COMMAND AND PERHAPS SOME ARGUMENTS
DEPENDING UPON THE COMMAND, AND TERMINATED BY A CARRIAGE RETURN.
MANY OF THE COLON COMMANDS HAVE
ABBREVIATED FORMS AND CAN BE EXECUTED BY SIMPLY TYPING SOME
CONTROL CHARACTER OR AN ALTMODE (ECHOS AS $) AND ANOTHER CHAR.



DDT FILE NAME CONVENTIONS

 SITS DDT DIFFERS FROM ITS IN THE
WAY FILE NAMES ARE INTERPRETED, BECAUSE SITS HAS A GENERALIZED
TREE STRUCTURE FILE SYSTEM. AT ANY TIME, THE USER HAS A DEFAULT
DIRECTORY WHICH CAN BE LISTED BY TYPING :LISTF. THE FILE
NAME THE USER TYPES IS INTERPRETED AS BEING RELATIVE TO EITHER
HIS DEFAULT DIRECTORY OR TO THE ROOT OF THE FILE SYSTEM. A
FILE NAME CONTAINING ONE OF THE ROOTS SUCH AS 0; 1; OR 2; IS
INTERPRETED AS BEING RELATIVE TO THAT ROOT. THE SEMICOLON IS
THE KEY CHARACTER.  A FILE NAME WITHOUT THE SEMICOLON WILL BE
ASSUMED TO BE RELATIVE TO THE DEFAULT DIRECTORY, THAT IS, THE
FIRST NAME TYPED SHOULD BE A FILE OR DIRECTORY IN THE DEFAULT
DIRECTORY, THE NEXT NAME WILL BE A FILE OR DIRECTORY IN THAT
DIRECTORY AND SO ON UNTIL THERE ARE NO MORE NAMES IN THE FILE
NAME STRING. EXAMPLES:

:LISTF			LISTS THE USER'S DEFAULT DIRECTORY.
:LISTF 1; USERS EPG	LIST'S EPG'S DIRECTORY IN USERS, DISK 1.

:PRINT FOO		PRINTS THE FILE FOO IN THE USER'S DEFAULT DIRECTORY.
:LOAD 0; . INQUIR	LOADS THE PROGRAM INQUIR IN THE . DIRECTORY
			FROM DISK 0.

COLON COMMANDS

   THE COLON COMMANDS MAY SPECIFY A DDT COMMAND, OR IF THERE
IS NO DDT COMMAND BY THAT NAME, DDT WILL TRY TO RUN A PROGRAM
WITH THAT NAME LOADING FROM THE USER'S DEFAULT DIRECTORY. THE
FILE MUST BE IN A LOADER FORMAT.  THE FILE IS LOADED WITHOUT
THE SYMBOLS AND IS STARTED IMMEDIATELY AS IF THE USER HAD TYPED
$G.  IF THE SYMBOLS ARE DESIRED WHEN THE PROGRAM RETURNS TO DDT,
THEY CAN BE LOADED VIA :SYMADD.

:BINLOAD  (FILE NAME) 	LOADS A FILE IN ANY FORMAT WITHOUT
			INTERPRETING THE FORMAT INTO AN INFERIOR
			SPHERE. THE PROGRAM CANNOT BE STARTED
			VIA $G. USEFUL FOR SEEING EXACTLY WHAT
			IS IN A FILE.

:CAPMODE		CAUSES DDT TO OPEN THE INFERIOR SPHERE'S
			CAPABILITIES INSTEAD OF MEMORY. THUS:
			3/  $S   PRINTS THE TYPE OF CAPABILITY 3.
			TO GO BACK TO LOOKING AT MEMORY, USE :ISPACE.

:DELETE (FILENAME)	DELETES THAT FILE.

:DSPACE			CAUSES LOCATIONS TO BE OPENED FROM MEMORY
			IN D SPACE.

:DUMP (FILENAME)	CREATES A FILE WITH THE GIVEN FILE NAME
			AND DUMPS THE CURRENT INFERIOR SPHERE
			IN ABSOLUTE LOADER FORMAT.

:ERROR			PRINTS OUT THE MEANING OF THE CURRENT VALUE
			IN TERMS OF THE ERROR NUMBERS RETURNED BY SITS
			IN THE PROCESSES ERROR WORD.

:FONT (N)		CHANGES THE CURRENT FONT OF THIS TTY TO
			FONT N. NOT ESPECIALLY USEFUL ON PRINTING
			TERMINALS.

:ISPACE			CAUSES LOCATIONS TO BE OPENED FROM MEMORY
			IN I SPACE. (USUALLY THE SAME AS D SPACE).

:LISTF (DIR NAME)	LISTS THE CONTENTS OF THE SPECIFIED DIRECTORY.

:LOAD (FILENAME)	LOADS THE SPECIFIED FILE INTO AN INFERIOR
			SPHERE. FILE MUST BE IN EITHER ABSOLUTE
			LOADER FORMAT OR PURE LOAD FORMAT.

:LOGOUT			RETURNS TO DDT'S SUPERIOR "SUCCESSFULLY".
			IF THE SUPERIOR IS SYSSPR, THE USER WILL 
			BE LOGGED OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

:MAPMODE		CAUSES LOCATIONS TO BE INTERPRETED AS
			PAGE DESCRIPTORS IN THE SAME FASHION
			AS CAPMODE. USE :ISPACE TO UNDO.

:NEWSPH			CREATES A NEW INFERIOR SPHERE WITHOUT
			LOADING ANY FILE INTO IT. A PROGRAM
			CAN BE WRITTEN AND RUN IN THIS FASHION
			ALTHOUGH USING ASSEMBLER IS EASIER.

:PDUMP (FILENAME)	CREATES A FILE AND DUMPS THE CURRENT
			INFERIOR SPHERE IN PURE FORMAT.

:PRINT (FILENAME)	PRINTS THE CONTENTS OF FILE ON THE TTY.
			TYPING CONTROL S CAUSES IT TO SHUT UP
			EVENTUALLY.

:REVERSE		CAUSES BLACK TO BECOME WHITE AND WHITE
			TO BECOME BLACK (GREEN?) ON TVS.

:SETD (DIR NAME)	CAUSES DIR NAME TO BECOME THE DEFAULT
			DIRECTORY. NOTE THAT DIR NAME IS INTER-
			PRETTED JUST LIKE A FILE NAME, SO THAT
			IF NO ROOT IS SPECIFIED, THE NEW DIRECTORY
			WILL BE INFERIOR TO THE OLD ONE.

:SSTAT			PRINTS THE VERSION NUMBER OF SITS AND
			DDT AND A RANDOM NUMBER INTENDED TO BE
			LENGTH OF TIME THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN UP.

:SYMADD (FILENAME)	LOADS JUST THE SYMBOLS FROM A PURE OR
			ABSOLUTE FORMAT FILE.

:SYSMODE		CAUSES LOCATIONS TO BE OPENED IN THE BOTTOM 32K
			OF ABSOLUTE MEMORY. (USED FOR LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM)

:?			PRINTS A LIST OF COLON COMMANDS.
