THOTS ON LOGO GFIX  (RESPONDING HAL MEMO AND JB OUTLINES.)
CAN BE CLEAR ABOUT HDW RESTRIXNS.

one word for all bit type objects: tiles, 8x8 and 16x16 tortoiseshells
not one word, but same way of designing/editing.
so the patern is the same but the objects are different.

it shd be ez to go from one to another; for a tile to be designed from a shell,
.

major good capability of this machine is to read the screen.  unlike logo-as-we-know
the turtles can respond to whats on the screen.  
needs further clarification.

should tilespace go away ?
    software as written provides fn's for mapping 'tween both dotspot & tile
    coord's.  seems that 
1.  only 256 chars/768 char positions requires some redundancy of pictures.
    you really can't mask this, so try & take advantage of it instead.

2.  use of tiles, stamps, turtle trails is a way.  notabluy, if you have
    a picture (design ?) it must be located one/one with tilespaces on the screen.
    no way around this w/o re writing the pattern definitions.
 
hal's color default ideas are good.  

original gary suggestion was 2 modes- one in which walking over screen caused 
tile definitions to change, and one whicch uses already designed tiles.
bad to illuse that you can draw indiscriminately allover screen becuse to
take full advantage you've got to re use tiles.

so: add to logo stuff to work at dotspot level: shiftpicture, copypicture,

you say:
CALL [TILE 4] "LEFTCORNER
PICTURE [TILE 5][FLIP LEFTCORNER]

TO FLIP :TILENAME               flip takes a tile as arg, returns tile.
new logo objects graphics-

tiles, turtleshells, colors, turtles, stamps.

screen isn't a logo obj but has characteristics anyway.

TO MERGE :TILE1 :TILE2
 CALL 1 "N
 CALL 64 "M
 XD :TILE1 N :TILE2 :M
END

TO XD :TILE1 N :TILE2 :M
 SDS :TILE1 N DS :TILE2 M
 CALL "M M-1
 CALL "N N+1
 IF M <1 THEN RETURN
 XD :TILE1 M TILE2 N
END

primitives that deal with pictures/designs/shapes. independent of color.
independent of design size.  independent of design use.

read/set dotspot .  *dotspot numbering ? 1,1 8,8 ? 1 - nnn ? next, rt left bk ?
picture as list of dotspots ? picture as dotspot prims.
