Class #1......April 03

1. We introduced her to the buttonbox using the plastic overlay.

2. In the beginning she was typing with her thumb (right hand) looking
at the turtle and without seeing what she was typing. We have to ask her 
to do the typing and then look at the turtle.

3. She enjoyed making the turtle go behind some objects on the floor
(desk, wheelchair).  She did not engage herself in games like "gate" or
"ball", etc.

4. It seems that she understood quite well what was going on.

1. We started her using Annette's program because she seemed to be
paying attention to the screen.  But she then looked for the floor
turtle responses.

2. We switched to the floor without overlay.  But she insisted on
having overlay.

3. We switched to buttonbox, still using Annette's program  which
was total confusing because she was typing without seeing what she was
typing.

4. We switched to original set up using overlay (buttonbox)

5. Clearly she recognized FD and BK followed instructions.  The use of
turns seems random.  Did not respond to our request.
