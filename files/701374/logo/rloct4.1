1THE END OF THE STUDY0
     In the years following the intensive period of The Intimate Study, playing Tic tac toe lost social currency with Miriam and me.  My energies were much absorbed by the analyses and composition of One Child's Learning.  Peggy, a second daughter, was born to our family.  Miriam couldn't find a tolerable partner for the game, but this was not a major concern to her for she, as well as I, had other preoccupations.

     Two sorts of play occurred during this period of relative inactivity.  First were the few game sessions we did play.  Second was Miriam's solitary play and her reflection upon it.  From these two sorts play, two new developments arose: Miriam discovered a new strategic objective beyond the three corner fork; she also became capable of game length prediction.  The first development is highlighted by the games of session 22; the second by the games of session 23.

GAMES 22.1 - 22.2 (@8;--;--)

In solitary play, Miriam first achieved then later recognized her victory by a fork and sequence of moves of her own discovery.  Her expert win and her view of it is contrasted with those set out in Figure I.2

0     The limited extent of Miriam's play is witnessed by her testimony as we began session 22:

Bob:    Let me ask you something here.  You remember when we were doing
     our research up at the lab, you and I used to play Tic tac toe a lot.
Miriam: Yes.
Bob:    Have you played Tic tac toe much with anyone else ?  Since then ?
    I mean, like have you played with Robby or kids at school ?
Miriam: No.
Bob:    If you had to count up all the Tic tac toe games you played since
    then, how many do you think it would be ?
Miriam: About...30.
Bob:    Thirty ?... Who did you play them with ?  I know you played some with me.
Miriam: Mostly I play by myself.

     As I introduced my objective, Miriam introduced her own: to apply her newly discovered tactic against me.  Behind this more independent stance of hers is a stronger sense of our play as between conflicting opponents.  This "antagonism" undercut the loud thinking openness of our earlier play.

Bob:    What I have in mind is to ask you a couple of questions and play 
    some Tic tac toe - but the kind of playing we're going to do is
    we're going to talk about 'em and play as we go along.  O.K. ?
    Are you willing ?
Miriam: Yep.  I got a new trick - er - a new tactic.
Bob:    Oh, good.  We can talk about that now.
Miriam: I'm not going to tell it to you.  I'm going to keep it quiet.

After a short discussion of the game rules, this issue surfaced again:

Bob:    Let me ask you one more question - how much do your strategies
    or tactics depend on whether you go first or the other guy goes first ?
Miriam: Some of them have to.
Bob:    What do you mean ?  Can you give me an example ?
Miriam: Well, if I want to get three corners, I go in the one corner.
    If he goes in that corner (cell 3), that strategy's gone up in smoke.
    I go here. He goes here. I go here.  See what I mean ?
Bob:    Not exactly.  What I would like you to do... Are there any other
    examples you know of strategies that depend on who goes first and
    who goes second ?
Miriam: Oh, my other one does, but I don't want to tell you because we
    haven't played with it before, and I don't want to ruin the game,
    telling you my new strategy.

     Luckily, Miriam's new strategy is clear from her play and commentary on the gamnes 22.1 and 22.2:

Bob:    Your strategy requires that ?
Miriam: Not really.
Bob:    Not really ?  O.K.  Where do I go ?
Miriam: Well, either in this place or this one (cell 2 or 6).
Bob:    Let's suppose I go in this one here (cell 2).
Miriam: (Moves B in cell 5).  You go here (cell 9).
Bob:    Why do I have to go down there ?... (moves to cell 9)
Miriam: (Moves C in cell 7).
Bob:    Arrgh ! I see what good it does.
Miriam: (chortles).
Bob:    You've go it two ways to win.
Miriam: Two ways, like that.
Bob:    We don't have to play that out.  You've defeated me clearly.
    Masterful. Let's play another one here.  You go back in that corner.
    That's where you went the first time.... And I want to try some of 
    those other places and see if I can get away from you and your new
    tactic.  I'm going to go down here (cell 8).  That's on the side away.
Miriam: (Moves B in cell 5).
Bob:    Arrgh !  (Moves b in cell 9). This is a different game.  See,
    I've got  a  way to win....
Miriam: (Moves C in cell 7)
Bob:    Oh no !
Miriam: Careful of your moves, Buster.
Bob:    So you've got two ways to win now.  Let me ask you something.
    When did you invent this trick ?
Miriam: Oh, I was playing with myself.
Bob:    Well.... That's another one for Miriam.... When did you do this ?
    Was it recently or years ago ?
Miriam: Recently.... See, what I happened to do (Here Miriam moves to her
    desk and returns with a copy of Richard Scary's Rainy Day Book)....
    What I did is I went X.  He went O. I went. He went O.

In a final comment on the discovery of this new tactic, Miriam added that she had played the game and only later realized that she had created a fork with her third move.  (This comment is born out by the appearance of the original game, where the first six markers are made in brown crayon and the last, the  winning move (D) is marked in ball pen.)
     Notice that once Miriam discovered this new tactic, its pattern played a role as a strategic objective, analagous to that of the three corner fork.  Further, although it was developed originally with a game of form C4, Miriam applied it equally readily to openings of form C2.  That is, the identity of the tactic is based specifically on the pattern of the fork and the crux common to the two opening forms. Figure 22-1 represents Miriam's knowledge as having now three modes of play.  After discussing Miriam's skill as witnessed in session 23, we will compare her opening play, as augmented by this new fork, with the expert play described in Figure I.

This session explored three issues: what did Miriam recall of table turning; could she predict her victory from opening configurations of markers (and prove her judgment correct); how would she judge the sameness/differentness of symmetrical games.2

0     When I asked Miriam what "turning the tables" meant, she allowed as how she had no idea.  I tried again, "Think of when we used to play; suppose I won."  Miriam responded, "Then we would turn the tables and I would win."  We worked through game 23.1, after which I asked Miriam to turn the tables on me.  She began copying her own first marker, A.  When I hesitated, she altered her play to that of game 23.3.  Notice that she was tempted to place the linking move (C) in cell 3, but on reconsideration she placed her link in cell 5.  We must conclude that she remembered of table turning only the purpose as she had conceived it, alternate winning.  The requirements of that task, however, are so simple that she easily re-invented the procedure with the smallest hint that her first guess was incorrect.2

Of the seven games above, five permit expert wins (only M1 and C5 do not). The theme connecting these games was forecasting victory.  The typical sequence was my asking Miriam, after my opening response, whether she would defeat me and, if so, how.  In game 23.4, Miriam made a gesture to move in the middle cell before questioning began.  I knew this would cloud the issue and so moved on to the next game.  After move a of game 23.5, I raised the question of prediction:
.ss
.indent 1
.nofill
Bob:    Will you beat me ?
Miriam: Yes, I think so.
Bob:    How ?
Miriam: I'll move here (cell 9), then you move here (cell 5), then
     I move here (cell 7) and get two ways to win.
.indent 0

.ds
.adjust
This game joins together in Miriam's link placement a "forced move" and the three corner fork. (Notice this game is different from that game C3 in Figure I.)  In game 23.6, Miriam predicted victory also:
.ss
.nofill
.indent 1
Bob:    Will you beat me (after move a) ?
Miriam: (a long pause - we may assume she was working out the game in her
    mind.) Yes.  I'll move here (cell 5).  You'll move here (cell 9), and
    I'll use my new tactic.
.indent 0

.ds
.adjust
In game 23.7, Miriam responded "yes" to my prediction question as she wrote move B, and continued,
"You're forced to move here (cell 3) and I get two ways to win."  Miriam's pause before answering that she would win was common to game 23.10 as well, where she objected to my even asking her the question because she was "trying to think".  She admitted on rendering her judgment that she had the complete game worked out in her head.  In game 23.10, when she said I would move b to cell 9, I objected.  Miriam countered that I HAD to move there or she would win directly.  There can be no clearer indication that she was using with awareness the idea of offensive forced moves.	
          In games 23.8 and 23.9, Miriam was appropriately unceratin about whether she would win.  In 23.8, I accepted the pitfall.  Miriam was drawn into the wrong corner (cell 9) in linking her middle and corners fork.  She realized the mistake herself and corrected it immediately.  In 23.9, I asked:
.ss
.indent 1
.nofill
Bob:    Where should I move ?
Miriam: Well...
Bob:    Suppose I'm dumb.
Miriam: Move there (cell 7).
Bob:    Suppose I'm not so dumb.
Miriam: Then move up here (cell 6).

.ds
.adjust
.indent 0
What I conclude from these observations is that Miriam is now able to determine and prove whether she will win or no.  At the end of the study, she has acheived that stage of procedural comprehension presented in the introduction and exemplified most fully here.  Notice that her uncertainty in the indeterminate games is both appropriate and supported by her ad hoc comprehension (game C5).
     Let us compare Miriam's command of expert play with that exhibited by Figure I.  Where Figure I sets out five corner opening games, with  expert wins for games C1-C4, Miriam claims to know two tactics (the three corners fork and the middle and corners fork) and shows flexible command of game C5.  Her new tactic will succeed with opening games C2 and C4.  She interprets her wins at C3 games as a case of the three corner fork she originally learned in the context of game C5.  Notice that the order of the opponent's marker placement is different.  Miriam may not have marked that difference, although she knows she will win a C3 game and can not be certain with a C5 game.  The conclusion is that Miriam's conception of her strategy is quite different from the systematic comprehension of possibilities presented in Figure I.
     We are left with a puzzle about game C1.  Why is it Miriam has not mastered that game as she has the others ?  We could ascribe that fact to chance and suppose, with more time, she will stumble into some circumstance where she will discover another new tactic that will cover that opening game.  There is nothing wrong with such a stance.  However, given our richness of knowledge about Miriam's comprehension of Tic tac toe, we can go further and describe a sense in which the C1 game is "harder" to develop an expert win for than either the C3 or the C2 and C4 games.  Recall Kohler's description of "roundabout ways" and an animal's ability to use them as his primary criterion of intelligence [N]:

.indent 5
.ss
"...We tend to speak of 'intelligence' when, circumstances having blocked the obvious course, the human being or animal takes a roundabout path, so meeting the situation...."

.ds
.indent 0
If we conceive of the competition between microworld clusters as ongoing, despite the dominance of one, we can see those paths of play as easiest where the moves proposed by competing microworlds are the same.  For example, in a game of opening C2, where the opponent leaves the middle cell empty, Miriam's POSITION-world and her "new tactic" world would both propose a move to the middle cell.  In contrast, to attempt an expert win as proposed in Figure I
would entail competing proposals from the POSITION-world (for cell 5) and some strategic world (for cell 7).  In this specific sense, the expert play would be harder, would even be seen as requiring a roundabout way to solve the problem of where to move in order to achieve a victory.
       Let's suppose that Miriam's preference grid is general, the kind of a structure naive players operate with.  Using Kohler's criterion of roundabout ways, we can decide which games should be hardest to learn by asking which games require most detours before achieving a fork.  Consider this contrast:2

.ds

0Miriam's new tactic, requiring only the initial detour of all corner opening play, was hard to learn (after all, it took years to discover).  The expert win of Figure I (game C2E), requiring two detours, is harder.  By this same criterion, the expert win of game C1 is hardest of possible corner openings because it requires a vacant middle cell until the fork is linked.  (Game M2, requiring zero detours, should be easiest of all to learn, as its common prevalence testifies.)
     I offer the preceding speculations, not in the attempt to convince anyone of their final correctness, but to show the kinds of questions which are surprisingly accessible at the intersection of psychology and epistemology with the class of Artifical Intelligence concepts which this analysis brings to bear.

1DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS0
     Thus far I have presented a story, a long and very detailed one.  I have offered no theory.  Even now, all I can offer is a description of that story, not a theory.  But lest the endeavor seem insignificant, I assure you it is a description with aspirations.  Let me explain.
     Recall the outstanding contribution of Winston's early work was his observation that a description, through processes of part and relation emphasis, could be elevated to the status of a concept.  He presented an example of an object description, of an arch, which I would say initially aspired to be a concept of that class of objects.  We could call such an aspiring description an ur-concept of an arch.  What I struggle to produce here is, similarly, an ur-theory of how social experiences generate the personal construction of the individual mind.  This ur-theory may be criticized as showing only ad hoc comprehension.  Indeed, it stays very close to the process description and is not worked out to that level of provable prediction Miriam showed in her latest games of Tic tac toe.  Let us turn now to the task at hand, developing an ur-theory of the interaction of social experiences and the mind, with a compact example of the processes I have come to see as central.

AN INFANT'S INTRODUCTION TO KNOCK-KNOCK JOKES -
     Miriam has a long history of joke telling and invention. [R].  She plays with her infant sister, Peggy, often because she enjoys the play and often because she is "stuck" with her while we parents are otherwise occupied.  (The point is that their relation is basically amicable but also more than that.)  Peggy imitates us and her siblings and has begun imitating Miriam's knock-knock jokes [R+1]. This was her first form of imitation:
.nofill
.ss
.indent 1
Peggy: Knock-knock.
Bob:   Who's there ?
Peggy: (Broad laughter).

.ds

Peggy plied her jokes upon me time and again.  It was amusing enough because of her imperfect command. We both enjoyed it.  Eventually, the joke became wearing.  I tried to begin the joke with her.  When I began "Knock-knock", she did not reply; I would say she COULD NOT reply.  I tried many times.  Even though she sensed something was expected of her, she did not reply.
     I rise earlier than the others in my family.  The next morning I heard Peggy talking to herself in her crib: "Knock-knock.  Who's there ?  (Laughter)."  Later, when she was brought down to breakfast, I cooked Peggy a muddled egg and we sat down to eat.  Her first words were "Knock-knock".  In my turn, I tried again:

.ss

Bob:   Knock-knock.
Peggy: Who's there ?  (Laughter).

.adjust
.ds
.indent 0
That same afternoon, Miriam reported to me with great excitement, "Dad, Peggy can say 'Who's there'."  I consider this a very simple and lucid example of the processes of the articulation of complementary roles.

ELEMENTS OF THE EXAMPLE - 
     Someone, a learner with (most probably) a relatively inferior comprehension, is engaged socially with more comprehending people - in this case focussed around what is literally a script for a joke's telling.  The reasons for their common engagement may be of any sort, friendly, helpful, even antagonistic. During the engagement, the social demands push at the boundaries of comprehension of the person with a syngnostic perspective.  Peggy was regularly asked "who's there ?" at first, but later she was expected to respond that way herself and could not.   Subsequently, in a time when deprived of that social engagement, the  learner recalls and recreates that kind of engagement, compensating for the solitude by simulating  the role of the other actor.  The first process I call "HOMELY BINDING" ("homely" is a contracted form of "home-like"): the learner attaches herself to uncomprehended routines of engagement (in both the theatrical and programming senses of the term "routine").  The process may be friendly or not so - but it is more aptly and generally described by that wide ranging class of intimate relationships that characterizes the interactions of a small society, the home.  The second process, "LONELY DISCOVERY", occurs when the learner is deprived of social engagement - left to her own devices - and she uses those devices to re-enact the uncomprehended experiences - during which endeavor the simulation of the other actors imposes a real demand for the distinction between roles and their relations which was lacking in the initial engagement.  My name for this pervasive and oft repeated sequence of homely binding and lonely discovery is "THE ARTICULATION OF COMPLEMENTARY ROLES".
     The relation of individual construction to social experience is that more perspicuous discriminations are required for controlling multi-role enactment of scripts than are required for acting in them.  On the stage, an actor may memorize his lines and take cueing from the tag end of a fellow actor's preceding speech.  An actor, or a learner, in taking on two roles must do more, must not only cast herself in the second role but must also function as director of the entire scenario.  It is the director's function ( a global control of the script's progression as distinct from serial cueing) which requires the articulation of roles; it is this which leads to a refined comprehension of the script.
				
ARTICUILATION OF ROLES AND COMPREHENSION - 
     In the Introduction, we discriminated four stages of comprehension.  Of Miriam's Tic tac toe knowledge we see these applications.  MINIMAL COMPREHENSION characterizes Miriam's play at the beginning of the study, where her play was guided by  propensities or by the three corner objective - devoid of any sense of how to achieve it regularly.  FRAGMENTARY COMPREHENSION is quite clearly exemplified in Miriam's ad hoc knowledge of the two outcomes of game C5.  PROCEDURAL COMPREHENSION is exhibited by Miriam's proof of victory predictions in session 23 (and occasionally earlier).  A SYSTEMATIC COMPREHENSION is witnessed by the view of Tic tac toe presented in the Introduction. 
      Miriam does not approach systematic comprehension.  Her classification of games is quite different from that, in kind.  She knows "two tactics", the elements of which are recognized opening configurations and a crux which forces the opponent to some cell so that afterwards she may achieve a fork.  The two crux-fork couples both cover several opening games and are thus the essential elements of the "tactics" as Miriam sees them.
     How does transition from one stage of comprehension to the next relate to the processes of homely binding and lonely discovery ?  Miriam's report of her inventing her second tactic is a case of lonely discovery.  The essence of that insight is her seeing the necessary connection between the crux and the middle and corners fork.  This occured during her reflection upon a previously played game.  The sense of a casual, goal-free, mulling-over of previous activity calls up William Wordsworth's observation that 'poetry is passion recollected in transquility'.  We should not be surprised at the echo of this great poet and early psychologist converging with my formulation that  "UNDERSTANDING is a description of  experience articulated through reflection".  We may choose to say that both systematic and procedural comprehension are forms of understanding without doing violence to the common sense of the terms - but it would stretch that use unacceptably and with little purpose to include under that term Miriam's initial propensities and her fragmentary comprehension, as of specific games.  Thus we set the watershed of understanding between fragmentary and procedural comprehension.
     The main question to ask, then, is how the transition from a fragmentary to a procedural comprehension occurred.  Does that transition fit with the description of the articulation of complementary roles ?  If the essential insight in Miriam's "new tactic" is the necessary relationship of the crux and the fork, what is implicated is a revision of the idea of forced moves so that they are seen as offensive tools as well as being threats to which a defensive response must be made.  What was behind this discovery ?  This transition must have come in multi-role play where Miriam could feel herself "being forced" as simulated opponent by the crux she herself placed as initiator.  This insight occured as a lonely discovery, but its social underpinnings were both pervasive and manifest (It's true that I explicitly told Miriam at one point, in discussing game --.-- that what was required was "forcing the other guy's next move out of the way so you could get your two ways to win".)  But we should distinguish between being exposed to some formulation and the internal process by which the individual makes sense of what, in terms of experience and at a prior stage, he may already have "known".  It is the internal re-appraisal of what is already known that often brings with insight the feeling of "deja vu".  Multi-role play grew out of table turning and a second practice: my permitting Miriam to specify what moves I should make. (Partly this may be seen as an artifact of my research objectives, but it was also a matter of homely binding.  If I felt she would be too unhappy at my making a move she could anticipate, I let her choose my move - because our play was more important as a social process than was my winning.)  The question of predicting victory was much a research question; but it also was more, with a significant social component: I don't like condescending in play (or otherwheres).  This salient question in our play must have sensitized Miriam to the issue of necessary connection between crux and fork.  The social concentration on these question elevated them to the status of issues.  Her prior knowledge also was relevant.  Her fragmentary but firm grasp of the C5 games must have carried with it at least the knowledge that outcomes were not random but were determined.  This ad hoc knowledge was very much the fruit of extensive social engagement - beginning with Robby's introduction of the three corner fork through that  multitude of games from which C5 emerged as one opening of well-known outcomes.
     We can also ask how Miriam moved from the propensities of minimal comprehension to fragmentary comprehension. With her strong commitment to the C5 opening ploy, there was no initial sense of the opponent's role at all.  The distinction between the winning and tieing outcomes was socially driven.  Without her attending to forced moves, "tolerable" mature play would have been impossible.  The idea of defensive forced moves is the socially determined sine qua non for initiation and play as an independent player.  Without command of forced moves, the game is random and unacceptable to such an opponent as I am. The squabble between Miriam and Robby in session 2 is more evidence of the social pressure behind this original transition.
     Since Miriam did not develop a system comprehension of Tic tac toe, we can't ask how such a transition happened  - unless we are willing to admit as relevant how it happened for me,  to take my introspection and reflection upon the entries of a journal I kept during The Intimate Study.  Let me sketch my conclusions from reviewing that material.  My comprehension was first, at best, procedural.  As we two played, I was uneasy with my own ignorance.  How could I understand Miriam's play without a solid grasp of the material ?  I found it too hard to comprehend  an ongoing game and its possibilities in terms of thinking of some set of simple rules.  I began tracing out "chances to win" to improve my grasp of the game - and found this a dead end.  I began playing against myself games under the capitalized heading in my journal "EXPLORING OTHER GAMES".  First I played a C3 game to a tie - then found that with the crux in cell 9 I could have an expert win. Next a C1 game followed the same pattern: first I played to a tie, then, doing something different, I discovered an expert win.  With games C2 and C4 I went immediately to expert wins.  I also found one for the S3 game (but not S4).  Now aware that there were so many expert wins, I decided it would be useful to classify them to support my recall, to suppress the confusion I often encounter.  Here I realized that a classification by the two opening moves was adequate.  A further note, supporting the arguments advanced in the discussion of session 22, is that the forms of winning games I initially developed were the same as Miriam's "new tactic".  I later abandoned the initial "hard" solution for the "harder" expert wins of Figure I because this permitted the use of a common crux for the four games C1-C4. (I still have trouble recalling where the crux should go for games S3 and S4.) My side of this social engagement with Miriam over Tic tac toe led to an abnormal concern (for me) with such a game.  Because I owned a higher standard of performance for myself than was possible with my initially syngnostic perspective on the game, I constructed a richer and more controllable perspective through a process of lonely discovery based upon working out, articulating the complementary roles of the game.

     We come to the end of the study and what do we find ?

"Understanding is a description of experience articulated through reflection."

You may ask "Is that worth the effort ?"  I respond with the rhetorical question, "Is understanding worthwhile ?" and conclude that if we understand better what we "knew" before, that is significant learning.
