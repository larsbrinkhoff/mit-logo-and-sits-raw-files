          This cameo traces one child's learning about punning to exemplify
and pose a neglected but central difficulty in the study of significant human
learning, i.e. insight can't be scheduled.

INTRODUCTION -
.sp 2

          This is a simple story, invoking no expert theory of the domain of
joke invention; neither psychoanalytic nor literary theories of wit and comedy
are called upon.  We focus on learning about punning although other classes of
jokes are exemplified as a background against which the knowledge of punning
can be contrasted.  The observations recount the developing skill of one child,
Miriam, my daughter, at understanding and inventing jokes.  Any prospective
reader is right to ask why such material is worth his time.

          The invention of puns requires an ability to view one object
simultaneously from different perspectives.  The development of this capacity
is emerging as one of Miriam's central accomplishments during The Intimate Study
(an intensive, naturalistic study of her cognitive development from 6;0 to 6;6)
and is implicated in other skills she acquired, e.g. addition in the vertical
form of the hindu-arabic notation.  As this story unfolds, we will exemplify
what sorts of observations are required to understand that learning which derives
from the interconnection and reorganization of knowledges in the mind.  If the
methods I advocate are more like natural history than "Science" and are vulnerable
to criticism as subjective for their dependence upon naturalistic observation,
they do at least confront directly the unschedulability of insight, the failure to
deal with which has long impoverished the study of human learning.

          I can't think about learning in the abstract.  I need memorable examples
of learning to help me think about the process.  The examples presented in the
following text appeared over several years' time, but they are not merely 
representative.  Even though they are sparse, these observations are complete.
I feel justified in presenting this claim because inventing jokes has been a
much praised activity in my home.  The claim is born out not only by the pride
with which Miriam and her brother Robby exhibited their newly invented jokes but
even more by their unconstrained willingness to make gross and vulgar jokes.
(Readers easily offended may take this statement as a warning.)  Let us proceed
through the following examples to see how Miriam came to invent puns and then
discuss the implications of the learning.

          Puns comprise one class of jokes.  They must be distinguished from other kinds
of jokes so interpretations  may tease apart the elements of humor witnessed by enjoying
a joke.  At the age of six, three elements of humoir dominated the jokes in Miriam's
repertoire: contract-frustration, vulgarity, and insult.  Each of these terms can
characterize a class of jokes even though they frequently appear in combination.

          Contractual jokes depend on the establishment and violation of shared
expectations.  The first case is the most anti-social  in frustrating the expectations
of the victim.  Those following merely impede acting out of the script jokester and
victim accept.

          A short curriculum at table in my home has been one of telling jokes and,
since the children's repertoire is quite small, listening to them retelling jokes
told them.  The first, most primitive was:
