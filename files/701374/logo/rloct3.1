1ON HER OWN
.twinch 6.5

     0Miriam propelled herself to independence.  She had been my captive
antagonist at Tic tac toe for some five months when, while I was distracted
with other cares, she engaged another Logo-person in play.  Miriam's
opponent in session 10 was  our colleague Glenn.  I decided thereafter
to terminate instruction as such and attempted merely to evaluate what
Miriam had been able to learn.  Therefore my intentions as her opponent 
(in sessions 11, 12 , and 13) was not purposefully didactic (though it's
hard to keep the doctor down).
     If Miriam was my apprentice when under instruction, here she declared
herself a journeyman.  A journeyman can proceed at his task without direct
guidance from a master of the trade.  Nonetheless, a journeyman's work is
usually judged mediocre in quality.  Think of Samuel Johnson's quip upon
meeting a lady who spoke classical Greek in London: "The marvel," he noted,
"is like that of the dog who walks on two feet -- not how well 'tis done, 
but that 'tis done at all".  Miriam at six and a half held her own with 
a brother two years her senior (no slouch himself) and with a games-knowledgeable
colleague of ours (some mere twenty years her senior).

SYNOPSIS0

.twinch 5
FORCED MOVES -- Miriam made forced moves as required in defensive
play.  Her command of opening games C1, C2 and C3 required her offensive
use of forcing moves, but it is not clear that she was explicitly aware
of their role.
GAMES KNOWLEDGE -- Miriam's successful use of opening C2 in game 10.5,
though it required two games to effect, is evidence that it had a place
in her repertoire of "tricks".  Opening C4, encountered in 9.4 without
table turning, did not lead Miriam to an expert win in 11.1.  Game 12.1
shows Miriam's command of opening C3.  Her use of opening C1 to defeat
Robby in game 14.3 shows her offensive command of that game.  The M1
trap appears with Miriam as iniator in 13.1.  It appeared earlier in her
play with Glenn.  My accepting the trap permitted her to succeed with
the gambit (Glenn had declined the trap). Although Miriam readily seized
the opportunity of a fork, there is no clear evidence that she planned
the outcome this way.  Her knowledge of defensive games is far less
certain and stable.  Miriam avoided the trap of opening C5 but only did
so after a hint from Robby that a better move than her initial one
existed.  Miriam played game 15.1 to show me what she believed was a sure
defense against a corner opening. (Her opinion was wrong.)
REPRESENTATION -- The striking revelation that Miriam considered 
games 12.2 and 12.3 "both probably the same" (in the first of which 
she was the opponent and the second the initiator) makes explicit
Miriam's non-integration of serial and pattern aspects of the game. 
Such was earlier hinted at by her requesting Glenn to make the side
move in game 10.4 where she lacked the opening advantage.  With this
profoundly non-standard perspective, one which does not recognize the
opening advantage of the first player, with her failure to make a
distinction which adults assume, her representation was  more different
from the casual player's than any casual observer would guess.
RIGIDITY -- Miriam appeared to be developing more flexibility
in individiual games.  In 10.5 she defeated Glenn by the expert win
of opening C2 with his response a symmetrical variant of those she
had encountered.  Her comment that she "should have gone down there"
in game 13.3 coupled with her pushing through to a fork without
changing her crux shows that she was aware of and capable of playing
two different winning games for opening M2.  The oustanding achievement
in flexibility Miriam exhibited appears in game 14.5 and 15.1, where
she plays both sides of the game and made "smart" moves for both players.
Contrast this performance with the paralyzing rigidity of her inability
to play on in game 1.4.
LEARNING FROM AN OPPONENT'S PLAY -- The sequence of games 10.4, 11.2, 
and 11.3 is as good evidence as one could ask that turning the tables 
had become an intellectual property which Miriam owned and and freely
used.  Game 11.2, which duplicates 10.4, was played at her initiative.
Following her defeat by the expert win, Miriam spontaneously turned 
the tables (though I had to ask her if such was her intention in order
to respond appropriately).  In games 14.5 and 15.1 Miriam took the final
step and incorporated her opponent's play with her own.  Does it make
sense to say one learns from an opponent when one person plays both roles ?
Perhaps not, but that is a mere quibble.  It is precisely this skill that
is required to perform the analyses which lead to an explicit understanding
of specific games, the transfer of knowledge from aggressive to defensive
play, and, ultimately perhaps, to an articulate and well-organized grasp
of the mini-world of Tic Tac Toe.

ARGUMENT
Miriam thinks out loud in playing against our colleague Glenn.  She realizes against him the objective she defined with respect to Robby, i.e. to engage him in a game of form C2.  The working out of this objective further hints Miriam was insentitive to the role of opening advantage in play.2

0     One characteristic of my play with Miriam had been that we both felt free
to think aloud.  There was a tacit agreement that neither of us would be mean and
take advantage of such openness.  Thus when Miriam revealed in a game of opening C5
that she would beat me if I moved in either of the corners, most often I would
move there.  If I felt I was losing too much, I would complain of that and block
her victory.  During game 10.1, Miriam noted for her opponent Glenn that she would
defeat him should he move in the traps she had set.  He avoided the trap (and I'm
sure Miriam did not take it amiss).  Though the data are not clear for game 10.3 (Glenn could
not recall the sequence of moves), I would speculate that game  was also of
form C5.  Game 10.2 was a trap of opening M1 which Miriam avoided.

     The last three games of session ten are of central interest in describing
Miriam's developing competence. Miriam asked Glenn to open at a in 10.4.  Recall
her remark that she would ask her brother to make such a move (dialogue of game 7.7) 
and would use the trick (opening C2 expert win) against him.  Since Miriam had played
only with me in the interim, I infer that Glenn was playing in place of her brother.
Most remarkable was that Miriam got it all wrong !  Glenn moved first (the response 
for opening C2) then Miriam in her turn made the "opening" move.  This game is one
of form S3, which Glenn had the knowledge to win.  After being defeated, Miriam
and Glenn replayed the opening configuration but with her having the opening
advantage, and she defeated him.  His moving in a symmetrical variant of his opening
counter's position in the prior game is an indication that the choice was his.
(Miriam would have asked him to move in the same location as move a of game 10.4).
Glenn was unaware of our Tic tac toe research and its objectives.  In the third
game of the set, Glenn once more the initiator opened on the side.  Miriam eschewed
the gambit in which she lost at his last opening and adopted a middle-seizure
defense.  She learned something, caution at least, from her prior defeat and
victory with the corresponding opening games C2 and S3.  The hint that Miriam was insentitive to opening advantage is confirmed in a later section and its implications are discussed there.

Bob:    Let's see if you can beat me when I move right close here to you.
    Do you know whether you can beat me or not ?
Miriam: Unh-uh.
Bob:    You don't know ?
Miriam: (Moves B1).
Bob:    That's where you want to go ?  Miriam, I'm really surprised.  Why
    do you want to go there ?
Miriam: 'Cause then if I go here (cell 7), I can beat you.
Bob:    Now hold on.  You're trying to move there.  So then you'll get two
    ways to win ?... Let me show you've got a bug.  Miriam, I get to go
    next, and I'm planning on going there (middle, cell 5).
Miriam: Go here. (cell -- ).
Bob:    On no.  The good trick to beat me there is you have to force me to go
    someplace else.
Miriam: How ?
Bob:    Like, if you crossed out that move (B1 in cell 3) and moved in 
    a different corner, like down there (cell 7).
Miriam: Yeah ?
Bob:     Would it work then ?
Miriam: Maybe.  Would it ?
Bob:    What do you think ?  You force me to move over there (cell 4), then the 
    middle will be free.  You think that'll make it ?  O.K.... Go ahead.
Miriam: I did. (moves B2).
Bob:    Great.  Well, Miriam I am forced to move here, in this side place (cell 4).
    Your chances to win do what ?
Miriam: Come together, this way and this way (moves C).
Bob:    I will go down here with my c then.
Miriam: I will make this. (moves D).  I win, I win !

What emerges from this dialogue is that Miriam's plans do not incorporate any
consideration of her antagonist's response to the crucial move.  If this response
to the crux is not actively considered, she clearly can not appreciate the 
significance of the crux as the necessary bridge between opening and fork.  We conclude she can not have a well articulated appreciation of the significant parts or elements of a tic tac toe game and their interactions through the length of a game.  Her knowledge of specific games is "ad hoc" and does not approach "understanding".

     Game 11.2 replayed, at Miriam's request, her defeat by our colleague Glenn.
In game 11.3, Miriam spontaneously turned the tables on my play of game 11.2.
Miriam used table turning first to recover a past defeat, then to turn that game
into a procedure which she executed victoriously.

Bob:    I remember when you were playing with Glenn, you did a lot of playing
    on the side.  He started oin the side a lot.  Is that because you told
    him to every time ?  Or just because hwanted to after the first time ?
Miriam: Will you go over here (cell 6) ?
Bob:    Over here ?  What were you going to do  ?
Miriam: Here (cell 1).
Bob:    Who do you think will win ?
Miriam: Me ?
Bob:    Let's see.(moves a)... Now you think you're going to beat me by going in the
    corner ?
Miriam: (Moves A).
Bob:    That's a bug, Miriam.  Shall I show you why ?... Do you think you're
    going to win, or do you think I'm going to win ?
Miriam: I think you're going to win.
Bob:    How come ?
Miriam: You just told me.
Bob:    You want to see how I do it ?
Miriam: Yeah.
Bob:    I put my b right here, over top of the a (i.e. in cell 3). Now you
    have a forced move.... My good trick is that your second move (B) comes
    right under my a.  Now tell me what I've got (move C in middle), where
    my chances to win intersect.
Miriam: Two ways to win.
Bob:    How did I do that to you ?
Miriam: I'm going to go here (moves C).
Bob:    So you block my a-c and I go here.  One for Bob....Where do you want 
    to start ?
Miriam: (Moves A in cell 6).
Bob:    You're going to go where I went last time ?
Miriam: Yeah.
Bob:    Oh... Is this turning the tables ?
Miriam: (laughing) Yeah.
Bob:    Well, that means I have to go where you went last time, right ?
Miriam: Yeah.
Bob:    O.K. (moves a).  So you're turning the tables on me.  You're going
    to be able to beat me now ?
Miriam: Yeah. (moves B)
Bob:    I will put my b down here.
Miriam: Here (i.e. is move C in the right location ) ?
Bob:    Uh huh .
Miriam: C. (moves)
Bob:    You put it there because you've got one chance from the B through the
    middle and one chance from the A across.
Miriam: [unclear comment]
Bob:    Well, I'll go here, c.  So you turned the tables on me all right.  You
    like turning the tables on me ?  Is that a good way to play Tic tac toe ?
Miriam: Yeah.

0     Miriam showed herself in absolute command of game C3 (game 12.1).  Despite
my attempt to dissuade her from her crucial move B, she would not be moved.  In
our discussion of her rationale for choosing one move in preference to another,
Miriam explained lucidly that (after B) I had a forced move which resulted in her
ability to achieve two ways to win.

     My confusion during game 12.2 (I knew not where the crux should go) renders
the observation of that game useless.  Excessive good fortune, really the combination
of accident and Miriam's willingness to think out loud during our play, revealed 
with her recorded dialogue of game 12.3 the essential difficulty of her play and the
constraints which must delimit what table turning could have meant to her:

This is unexpected evidence of a distinction Miriam has not yet made but one 
which nearly every person else would see as implicit in the game.  It does matter
whether one goes first or second; Miriam apparently did not appreciate that fact.

     As the play of game 12.3 unwound, Miriam demonstrated that she proceeded in
form M2 without appreciating the fork she achieved.  After move b, I inquired:

Bob:    How do you figure out where to go next ?
Miriam: I just pick a space (moves C).

Miriam: I just picked a space.
Bob:    I mean... why don't you move over here then (cell -- ).  I think that
    would be a good place.
Miriam: No, no.  I want to move there.
Bob:    Is there any reason ?
Miriam: No.
Bob:    You stil don't want to tell me, huh ?  Well, I will stop your way to win
    there (C-A).  (Moves c).
Miriam: (Moves D1).
Bob:    Did you block me ?
Miriam: Yeah !
Bob:    'Cause you thought I had a way to win ?
Miriam: Yeah.  C and B.
Bob:    That's right.  I had a way to win.  Do you think it's better to block
    somebody who's got a way to win or is it better to win yourself ?
Miriam: Win.
Bob:    Yeah ?... Think you have a way to win ?
Miriam: No.
Bob:   May I call to your attention, Miriam, way to win you could have had ?
Miriam: (Short pause.  She picks up D1 and places at D2).
Bob:    That's why I was asking about that (points at C).  I wanted to know if you
    knew you had two ways to win.
Miriam: No, I didn't.

.indent 0

     Apparently confusing the blocking move appropriate in the second response of
a game of form C5 with an opening response, Miriam offered such a response, A1 of game 12.4, as the
"one safe place to go" after I began with a corner opening, a.  When I proved the
vulnerability of her response, Miriam ended the game by cheating. ( The particular
cheat she effected was to move her initial counter as A2 to inhibit my linking two ways to win.)  
     It is apparently true that Miriam's conception of Tic tac toe doesn't distinguish between games where she or her opponent is the initiator.  (I say she has a SYNGNOSTIC perspective, one which recognizes without discrimination what others can see as distinct.)  If she fails to make this vital distinction, can we say she understands anything at all ?  Indeed we can.  We can say she understands precisely what is indicated in our model.  Does any feature of the model, beyond the ad hoc knowledge of known results for specific games depend upon an integration of serial and pattern features of play ?  No.  But, then, isn't our model subject to profound misapprehensions ?  Surely so, as is Miriam's knowledge itself.  Further, Miriam's syngnostic perspective goes far to explain her uncertainty about game outcomes.  For example, if C2 permits an expert win and S3 (the cognate game form) defeat by an expert, should we be surprised that, for Miriam, the outcomes of games seem globally random however much forced moves locally determine the play ?  Does not the particular nature of this confusion help explain why the path out of a syngnostic perspective is by procedural comprehension and why the systematic comprehension MUST be a subsequent stage (as distinct from a regularly occuring consequent) ?  Indeed.
     If this syngnostic perspective on a central aspect of the game is altered, should we not expect the discrimination, when made, to render obsolete whatever prior knowledge Miriam owned ? The answer appears to be "no".  I take this to be a central issue in the development of mind.  The negative answer to this question renders comprehensible the adaptivity of the child's ego-centricity noted long ago by Piaget [W].  If one's conceptions are primarily in terms of one's own actions (these can be known and controlled step wise) discriminations based on interaction (appearing to the syngnostic perspective as random) come into being as incremental refinements of already established knowledge.  (I do not address here how systematic comprehension comes into being.)

0     Miriam defeated me in 13.1 after I accepted the trap of opening M1.  Her first attempt to circumvent a foreseeable loss in 13.2 (based on her move B1) was to cheat by taking two turns in a row.  When this was forbidden, she accepted Robby's advice to move at B2 (the location at which in the past I had blocked her games of form C5).  This was her first defensive use of opening game C5.  During game 13.3, Robby predicted Miriam's win after my move a ("She's gonna win".)  Miriam's comment after my move b ("I should have gone down there.") hints she did not share his conviction.  When Miriam moved C, Robby declared, "She's got you now".  Miriam quit playing after game 3.  (I would speculate that Robby's demonstration of more  powerful knowledge than hers made her uncomfortable; I conclude that her victory at games of form M2 were gratuitous, not earned by her understanding or even by her ad hoc knowledge.)

0     Miriam played most games of session 14 against her brother.  They tied in an opening game M1 at Miriam's initiation.  In his turn, Robby's corner opening led to Miriam's defeat by an expert game of form C3.  When Miriam opened the third game in the corner, Robby's opposite corner response led to her noisy complaint...and then this comment, "Robby, you're gonna kill me for this."  At this juncture, she made an effetice crux for game C1 and continued with a  "million dollar promise" that she would not move in cell 4.  (I interpret this promise as one drawing his attention to move b and egging him on to make it.)  After Robby made his forced move in cell 4, Miriam informed him she wasn't going there anyway.  At my question of whether she would beat him, Miriam replied, "Yeah, I think so."  and linked her two chances to win into a fork.  Miriam honestly beat Robby at a game at which he had been master in all their previous play.

     In the next game, Miriam made a gesture I find most satisfying in a social sense: she invited Robby to turn the tables on her.  Robby, not privy to our experiments with Tic tac toe, did not share with Miriam the specific meaning she assigned to that procedure.  Does game 14.4 show Miriam pursuing a three corner fork  despite the intrusion of Robby's c where a hole should be ?  Or was it a gift to him ?  I prefer the latter interpretation because Miriam mentioned to me her surprise that he didn't know how to turn tables.  Such a gift would be another way of alternate winning when your opponent can't turn the tables.

     The games were interrupted at this point.  Since I needed to go away for a few minutes, I asked the children not to play together till I returned.  Coming back, I found Miriam had been playing Tic tac toe against herself, in her words, "making smart moves for me and the other guy".  She showed me her play of game 14.5, where the first player wins after the second falls into the traps of opening C5.
     Attempting later to probe Miriam's ability to play defensively against a corner opening, I asked her to play as opponent a C1 game:2

0     I opened with corner a.  Miriam took over once the chalk was in her hand.  After move B, she paused and wavered,"No. He wouldn't move there."  I laughed (at her attempted cheat) and said "Oh yes he would."  Miriam made the smart move (c) for her opponent and concluded, "I block him in the center and he wins".  Thus we have a second example of Miriam's playing both sides of a single game.
     How can we integrate the newly exhibited flexibility in role playing (i.e. playing both initiator and opponent) into our diagram of Miriam's knowledge about Tic tac toe ?  Simulating an opponent is another method for alternating turns.  As table turning earlier displaced negotiation as the preferred method of alternating winning, now simulation displaces opponent-play when no opponent is available.  At best, this can be seen as a re-entrant invocation of one's own knowledge.  Such could exhibit both a doubling of the density of experience and a more intimate probing of one's own knowledge for its comprehension and perfection.  It might involve using one's knowledge of other opponents' play to construct speculations about their reasonings.  At least, it could involve using an opponent's turns to set up victories for the self.  Even this is a marked advance over one sided play, for the appreciation of the interaction possibilities of two players is the basis from which a serial understanding of Tic tac toe must derive.
     Let us represent this new capability in Figure 15-1 as the addition of a new player knowledge structure attached to the "Opponents".  We label it ALTER (for alter-ego) and note it's use of one's own knowledge for the opponent's play; and its liability to cheating influence from the self. Given that the formulation of Miriam's game knowledge was ego-centric and she did not have strong opposition in vying for the first move, we should not be surprised that the knowledge developed from opponent simulation be focussed on self-initiated play.

1OPENING ADVANTAGE

     An outstanding observation-based fact established by preceding sections is that Miriam was insentitive to the possibility of opening advantage.  Here we recount how she became sensitive to that possibility and how that sensitivity was exploited to lead her through experiences on the basis of which she arrived at a crisp formulation of the idea.

SYNOPSIS0

.twinch 5
REPRESENTATION -- Miriam's representation of Tic Tac Toe underwent
a major alteration by connecting order of moves to visible patterns
as distinguishing one game from another.
GAMES KNOWLEDGE -- Miriam formulated the opening advantage verbally
as "whoever goes first wins if he knows a good strategy."  I infer that
by a "good strategy" Miriam means whatever brings about a fork.
RIGIDITY -- Miriam exhibited significant knowledge of game C5 
and flexibility in play by first directing me to accept the trap she
set and then spontaneously explaining how I should have avoided it.
LEARNING FROM AN OPPOENT'S PLAY -- After a tie game (with the
unusual opening form S3 which permits an expert win), I replay the
game to demonstrate that opening advantage is not all tha matters.
Miriam spontaneously turns the tables in the next game.

REDUCED GAMES -
     At the close of The Intimate Study, we played the game Hexapawn and contrasted it with Tic tac toe.  Hexapawn is a game of pawn capture played on a three-by-three grid.  Each player starts the game with three pawns and an objective of either capturing  his opponent's three pawns or crossing one of his pawns to the opponent's side of the board.  Hexapawn, with respect to chess, is an example of a reduced game.  In the case of this example, it is important because the second player has a significant advantage (the expert second player can't be beaten).   One day in Miriam's first grade class (after she had finished her school work), we played a reduced game of checkers because I had to leave shortly.  I folded the board in half, and we both placed six checkers on our sides and commenced playing.  I cite these activities to show the extent to which playing with variations of standard games was a common activity within the microcultures of my family.  Finally, after the six games of session 10, I interrupted Glenn as he was introducing Miriam to Tic tac toe played on a four-by-four grid.  This background helps to make comprehensible  Miriam's invention of "Tic Tac Toe - Two in a Row" comprehensible:

     Miriam woke me early in the morning.  With some medicine she quickly returned to sleep while I confronted several sleepless hours before dawn.  After writing through those hours, I  dozed off in my chair -- then was awakened by an early telephone call.  I finally crawled back into bed, but Miriam, wakened by the telephone as well, popped into bed between my wife and me, and by her chatter and playing kept me drowsily awake.
     She asked first if I wanted to play "Tic tac toe - Four in a Row".  I responded that the game was too complicated for me, even before I realized her mode of play was to be marking moves by gestures in the air (as she spells words by letter gestures).  When I asked how she could possibly do that, Miriam explained  she was envisioning the grid as lines through a series of nail heads visible in the wallboard of the ceiling.  "Then all you have to do is make the marks there."  (apparently she felt she could remember her own moves to her requisite level of satisfaction.)  I still refused to play, even "Tic tac toe - Three in a Row".
     Miriam continued, "Hey, Daddy if you play `Tic tac toe -Two in a Row', the first guy always wins."  I asked what she meant.  Miriam explained, "If the X goes first, say in one corner, and the O goes in the opposite corner, the X still has two ways to win, every time."  I asked if she thought anything like that could be true for "Tic tac toe - Three in a Row".  "No, it couldn't", she concluded.

The next day Miriam played a single game of Tic tac toe at the Children's Museum.  She defeated the computer with an expert win because it fell in a trap of the C5 form.  No other play appeared before the games of the next day, to which we now turn.

ARGUMENT

During the following cited dialogue from this mechanically recorded session, Miriam passed from a state of believing that no such thing as opening advantage applied to the playing of Tic tac toe - Three in a Row to crisp formulation of what opening advantage means as it applies to Tic tac toe - Three in a Row.

Bob:    Remember, I think it was about two days ago, you said to me a thing
    I thought was really neat.  How about I give you the letters ?
Miriam: A, B, C.  They're all my letters.
Bob:    We're going to play Tic tac toe - Two in a Row.
Miriam: Tic tac toe Two in a Row is pretty cinchy.
Bob:    You tell me about it.  Why is it so cinchy ?
Miriam: 'Cause somebody - (interrupting herself) - I go first.
Bob:    O.K.  You go first, someplace.
Miriam: (Placing her marker down) A.... Where will you go ?
Bob:    I'm not too happy about this game.  Gee, it looks - do you think
    I can win ?
Miriam: (Laughing) No.
Bob:    Why not ?
Miriam: (Touching the three remaining cells) 'Cause I have to go here, or here,
     or here to win.
Bob:    Oh ?
Miriam: And you have only one move in a row.
Bob:    So whenever I go -
Miriam: (interrupting) I can always go somewhere else.
Bob:    So, I would -  Miriam, I think you're right.  That's very good.  You
    told me about that two days ago.  You figured it out and said for
    Tic tac toe Two in a Row, the guy who goes starts always wins...
    Is that right (placing  a marker on the board) ?
Miriam: Yep. (Placing a marker) AB.  I win !
Bob:    O.K.  But the guy who starts always wins.
Miriam: Yes.
Bob:    I would say the guy who starts has an OPENING ADVANTAGE (emphasis).
Miriam: Right.

The previous episode establishes the obviousness to Miriam of opening advantage  in a two-by-two game and documents the introduction of that phrase.  I proceeded to ask if there might be an opening advantage in the three-by-three game.  Miriam opined "Not very much" and went on to exemplify her meaning by playing out a game of gestures in the air. I asked her to play to game in some more readily interpretable fashion:

Miriam: (With a pleased, anticipatory, quiet smile). Dunno.
Bob:    I mean I can go here (cell 7) or I can go over here (moves 
    the marker over cell 8 - Miriam's smile fades).  Does it make any 
    difference ?
Miriam: (Innocent look - a trap) Or you could go here (the alternate
    corner, cell 3).
Bob:    Is that better ?
Miriam: (Sly smile)  Yeah.
Bob:    O.K.  I'll go there.  (Move b to cell 7).

Miriam: What ?
Bob:    Is there such a thing as opening advantage ?
Miriam: Yes.
Bob:    What's it like ?
Miriam: It's like you get (unclear word) - see the A, B, and C are 
    right there like that.
Bob:    Like what ?
Miriam: See, the opening advantage is if somebody blocks 'em there 
    (points to B-C column), they can win there (A-C row).
Bob:    That just means you have two ways to win.
Miriam: Yeah.
Bob:    That's not an opening advantage.  The opening advantage means 
    the guy who goes first gets to win.
Miriam: Yeah. I get to win. 'Cause you're stupid to do what 
    I tell you to.
Bob:    That's true....

What could be more clear than that Miriam had not connected her ideas of Tic tac toe with the concept of opening advantage I tryed to communicate.  Because I knew from the earlier sessions than Miriam did not consider as different moves making a  pattern of markers in one game and a  similar pattern placed in a different order, I presented to Miriam two game openings with markers in the same cells (games of forms M2 and S4) and tried to establish their difference:2

    or are they different games.
Miriam: Same.
Bob:    In what ways are they the same.
Miriam: (Tapping side and middle positions). The letters are in the same 
    places.
Bob:    Let's set up this same game on our board.  Where's your piece
    gonna be, if we're playing these two games here ?
Miriam: There. (Places A in middle cell).
Bob:    You played A.  I'll put down a right here (cell 4).  Now let's stop
    for a minute.  (You said these two games on the card are the same....
    What's the difference in what I wrote on that card ?
Miriam: You wrote "M First" and "B First".
Bob:    What do you think that means ?
Miriam: That means I won the first game ? (We had used such a representation
    to mark her victories in the past.)
Bob:    How could you have won ?  There are only two markers in place ?
Miriam: I don't know.
Bob:    O.K.  Whose turn is it now ?
Miriam: Mine (Smile).
Bob:    Why is it your turn ?
Miriam: 'Cause I went, then you went, then I go.

Bob:    Is that different from this game (Pointing to "B First") ?
Miriam: Yeah. (Smiles)
Bob:  If we were playing this game over here -
Miriam: (interrupting) B would go first.
Bob:    Yeah.  Does that make a difference ?
Miriam: Yeah.
Bob:    Let me ask you something. (Covering the B First game) If we were

Miriam: Dunno.  You've got all those open spaces.

Miriam's formulation of opening advantage was confirmed by subsequent games in session 17.  (Her formulation was not congruent entirely with mine as can be witnessed at the end of this following citation which can help us understand what Miriam means, specifically, by "a good strategy").

    block the threat of a-b in cells 5 and 6), put the C here (cell 7), right ?

Miriam: See, it's your move.
Bob:    I would win then.

This is a case where Miriam had the "oening advantage" (by my criiterion but not by her definition "whoever goes first who knows a good strategy can win").  Her conception is more related to the outcome than to the possibilities of the opening games.
     In game 17.9, Miriam executed an expert win in a C3 form.  The dialogue of that game exhibits her certainty of victory:

This is further evidence that for Miriam "opening advantage" has as its most salient element "the strategy which leads to a fork".
