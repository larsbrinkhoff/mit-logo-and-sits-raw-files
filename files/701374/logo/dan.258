0I. INTRODUCTION
.BR
1This paper is one of a series of reports resulting from an 18-month
study of an elementary school computer laboratory.2  The study,
funded by the National Science Foundation, and carried out by the MIT
LOGO Group in collaboration with the Public Schools of Brookline,
Massachusetts, provided fifty sixth-grade students with betwen 24 and
36 hours of computer time and instruction in LOGO, a computer language
designed for use by elementary school children.  The work of sixteen of
these students, representing a range of interests, work styles, and
abilities was monitored in great detail.  
From the data collected we have prepared a series of reports outlining in detail
the work of each child, and analyzing the learning of all sixteen
children in the areas of computer programming, mathematics and problem
solving. 2,3

The contrasting work of Donald and Deborah, two of the sixteen students
is presented in this paper.  The contrasts between the students give
rise to a number of pedagogical questions and issues which will be
considered in the concluding section.

The computer language LOGO was developed approximately eleven years
ago as a vehicle by which children could learn computer programming,
problem solving and mathematics in a learning environment; it grew out
of the cognitive psychology of Jean Piaget and an
approach to the design of computer languages based on ideas arising
from work in Artificial Intelligence.5,6,7   Children are typically
introduced to LOGO by using the computer to control a TURTLE, an
imaginary creature which lives on a graphics display screen, the
movement of which is controlled by commands typed at a keyboard; for example:
FORWARD 100, BACK 50, RIGHT 90, LEFT 45, etc.

FORWARD 100 moves the TURTLE forward 100 TURTLE steps and leaves a trace on the
display screen;  LEFT 45 causes the TURTLE to rotate 45 degrees to
the left.  Drawing pictures with the 
.page
TURTLE is an initial programming
activity with an immense resonance for most children.  Children can
identify with the TURTLE, imagining themselves going through its
motions as it carries out a particular task.  At the same time,
controlling the TURTLE becomes a metaphor for controlling the computer
itself -- like the TURTLE, the computer responds to an ordered series
of commands and to procedures, defined as series of commands.

The way in which the action of the TURTLE can lead to a geometric
design, as well as the method used by children to define procedures is
illustrated in the following simple examples.  Having drawn a square by
repeating the steps, FORWARD 100, RIGHT 90 four times, a student can
define a procedure by choosing a procedure title (BOX, for example) and
typing a series of commands in order.

1When the student types the new command BOX, the shape shown in figure 1
will be drawn on the display screen.  (The small triangle shown in
figure 1 represents the TURTLE.)  A similar procedure, TRI, could be
defined as follows:

1Having defined procedures BOX and TRI, the student can now use these as
commands to the computer, in effect developing his own private
language as he goes along.  In particular, they can easily be used as
subprocedures in creating the drawing HOUSE, or the abstract design,
FLOWER.

1These TURTLE commands, when embedded in a suitable interactive,
procedural computer language such as LOGO, provide the basis for a rich
universe of activities called Turtle Geometry, which includes cartoon
drawings, simple and complex geometric designs, mathematical theory
building, and computer games and animation.  Extensions of Turtle
Geometry have proven fruitful when used with advanced high school
students or MIT freshmen and sophomores.8  The universe of Turtle
Geometry provides a conceptual framework for such aspects of
mathematics as coordinate systems, positive and negative numbers, the
use of variables, symmetry and similarity, the significance of special
angles (30-60-90, 180, 360, etc.).  The computer programming involved
in beginning LOGO activities can include the notion of procedures and
subprocedures, recursion and iteration, the naming of procedures
and variables, the use of conditional logic in the form of simple stop
rules for repetitive procedures, the understanding of procedural
hierarchy, and the use of debugging strategies.

Within the universe of Turtle Geometry there is room for different
students, working individually, to create their own sub-universes or
microworlds with their own limited but expandable set of concepts,
and related activities and projects.  The pedagogy of a LOGO classroom
can be seen as the task of helping each child to create, explore and
extend his or her own microworlds.  In this paper we describe the
microworlds of two students, Deborah and Donald, who approached a
very similar project in very dissimilar ways.  
We feel that by focussing on these two individuals we
can demonstrate how the computational environment
of LOGO fosters the learning of children with very different
developmental levels, learning styles, and academic abilities.

1Deborah is considered by her teachers to be a slow learner.  In her
regular classes she often appears to be withdrawn, indifferent to the
subject matter or to her fellow students.  When she began work in LOGO,
she was totally dependent on the teacher -- requiring his reassurance
on matters as routine as when to type a carriage return.

Deborah was able to slowly build her confidence and understanding by
limiting her choices of LOGO commands and inputs, limiting the goals of
her work, and by working in a way that minimized the chances of error.
While Deborah began her LOGO experience by asking for help at 
every turn, she had a deeply ingrained resistance to new ideas or
concepts.  For a long time she rejected the use of subprocedures,
which could have greatly expanded her
possibilities.  It was as though she deliberately provided herself with
a very definite and restricted microworld in which to operate.

Deborah used as few different commands as possible in her work.  Basic
TURTLE commands along with arc primitives RARC and LARC were almost the
only commands she used.  For inputs to TURTLE commands, she used only
multiples of 10, up to 100.  If a larger effect was needed, she would
use two steps, as in FORWARD 90, FORWARD 30.  

Deborah began by
using only inputs of 30 for all TURTLE commands, and gradually expanded to include other
numbers, although 30, 60 and 90 continued to be her favorites.
This microworld which Deborah chose for herself
is very nearly as rich as all of
Turtle Geometry.  It includes squares, triangles, circles, stars,
men, rabbits, and a variety of abstract designs, as well as the
mathematical concepts of perpendicularity, inverse operations, the
total turtle trip theorem, symmetry, similarity, estimation of lengths
and angles, planning and debugging, and procedure writing.

By limiting her inputs to numbers such as 30, 60 and 90, Deborah
actually enhanced the possibility that random explorations would produce interesting
results.  At the same time, she seemed to have a high degree of visual
intuition, often choosing precisely the correct input to produce a
desired effect.  Her patience in a one-step-at-a-time mode of operation
was remarkable.  Her format was quite stereotypic.  (1) carry out
one turtle step (turn, move or penup); (2) check to see if that looks
right on the screen; (3) if so, write down the step and continue; (4)
if not, clear the screen, retype all the steps previously written down
and try another choice for the qustionable step; (5) when a design looks
good, choose a name for it, and copy all the steps to make a procedure.

As an example of Deborah's success with this approach, we examine the
way in which she drew a six-pointed star without making a single
mistake.  She began by turning the turtle RIGHT 30, and used a
combination of FORWARD 70s and RIGHT 60s to complete the star.  The
actual rotations required to construct the star were RIGHT 120 at each
point, and LEFT 60 at each inner vertex.  The way Deborah
accomplished these rotations was quite typical of her work.  After each
forward step, Deborah would turn the TURTLE RIGHT 60.  She kept turning
it RIGHT 60, until the TURTLE was headed in what seemed to her to be the 
right direction.  This
required two repeats of RIGHT 60 at each point, and five repeats of
RIGHT 60 at each inner vertex.  At one inner vertex she missed the
correct orientation, and calmly repeated RIGHT 60 a total of eleven
times until the TURTLE was aimed in the right direction.  When she
copied the steps in her notebook, she copied all eleven RIGHT 60s
without any hesitation.

1It was not until quite late in the series of classes that Deborah was
ready to undertake a major project.  She drew a picture of a rabbit in
her notebook, and asked the teacher if he thought that would make a
good project.  He suggested modifying the rabbit, to make use of
straight rather than curved lines, and helped her redraw the picture in
a more simplified form.
.block 22
.sp 20

0(figure 7)1

Although Deborah began by trying to draw the rabbit as a long series of
commands, she soon accepted the suggestion that she break
the problem into parts, and make each part a separate subprocedure.
Although her work was directed toward an overall goal and involved a
certain amount of top-down planning, she constructed each part of the
rabbit piece by piece in an exploratory fashion.  Once again
her choice of inputs to FORWARD and RIGHT commands were such that it was
relatively easy for her to make the design come out the way she wanted.
Without any apparent planning, she chose the length for the sides of
the rabbit's head (FORWARD 90 FORWARD 30) in a way that made it easy for
her to locate the eyes and nose symmetrically.  To locate the eyes
she positioned the TURTLE at one side of the head, and moved it
FORWARD 30.  Deciding that that looked like the right spot for an
eye, she drew a circle of radius 20.  She then moved the TURTLE twice
more in steps of FORWARD 30, decided that that looked about right for
the second eye.  Thus she was able to locate both eyes symmetrically.
It was apparent that she had not decided that the rabbit's head was
120 steps across, and that she could therefore locate the eyes
symmetrically 30 steps in from each edge.  More simply, she 
knew that 90 and 30 were useful numbers and that if she kept trying
FORWARD 30 it ought to come out right.

1With the completion of her rabbit project, Deborah had almost totally
reversed her initial feelings of dependence and incompetence.  She
invited her parents, teachers, and school principal to visit the
computer lab, and in many ways, demonstrated to her visitors and
classmates her new found sense of confidence, satisfaction, and power.

Donald's work, which provides a striking contrast to Deborah's, was
characterized by a strong component of advance planning, and the
creating of structures within which problems could be solved.  At the
same time, Donald was quite ineffective at the visually-based,
exploratory modes of problem solving which were so useful to Deborah.
He had difficulty estimating angles, and making use of the visual
feedback provided by his explorations to improve his next attempt.

Throughout his work Donald was extremely receptive to suggestions from
the teacher, often making use of new ideas before he fully understood
them.  In this way, he was able to incorporate 
strategies that would continue to prove useful as he gradually came to
understand them through use in more than one context.  He seemed to
have the confidence that he could make use of the teacher's suggestions
effectively and that he would eventually understand them, even if the
concepts were a bit hazy at first.

As an example of both the effectiveness and the difficulties associated
with Donald's structured planning approach as well as the frustration
he experienced with visual approaches to problem solving, we consider
his construction of a house from a square and a triangle, a common
LOGO task, tackled by many students at an early stage of their LOGO
experience. 

At first Donald attempted an exploratory approach to solving this
problem.  He began by having the TURTLE draw a triangle on the screen,
making use of the TRI procedure described above.  Having started by
drawing a triangle, Donald established a framework for solving the problem
corresponding to the initial orientation of the triangle.  Asked to
draw a picture of what he was trying to accomplish, he made the diagram
shown in figure 9.
.block 11
.sp 9
.ce
0(figure 9)

1Since he was now dealing with two disorientations, the gap between
the TRI and BOX procedures, and the tilted orientation of the entire
shape, Donald had more difficulty than he could handle, and in an
hour of exploration, never succeeded in resolving this problem.

At the next class, the teacher suggested that Donald draw the BOX first.
This suggestion provided him with enough new insight to devise a plan
for solving the problem.  Donald avoided the usual
problem of finding the rotation needed to attach the triangle to the
upper left hand corner of the box.  He moved the turtle to the
upper right hand corner of the box, reversed its direction, and then
drew the triangle so that its first side was along the top of the box.
In this way he resolved the problem analytically, eliminating the need
for visual explorations.

1Donald's HEAD project occupied him for more than 12 class periods --
more time than any other student devoted to a single project.
This project also began with a plan, a cartoon-like drawing
of a man's head.  After one
session of exploratory work, Donald drew a revised plan, and worked
with his teacher to create a superprocedure designed to draw the
entire figure.
.block 24
.sp 22
.ce
0(figure 11)

1Donald's original superprocedure, TO HEAD, included the first six
features of the head:  the outside (BOX), EYES, NOSE, MOUTH, BEARD and
HAIR.  Once the superprocedure was written, each subprocedure became a
mini-project, requiring one or two classes to resolve.  Each feature of
the head required it's own construction plan, a combination of the
analysis and exploration needed to carry it out.  While working on the
features of his head, Donald made use of a great deal of teacher
asistance -- especially in developing approaches to geometric analysis
that were necessary to overcome his difficulties with visual problem
solving. 

When Donald came to his subprocedure, EYES, for example, he could not
resolve the problem of how to locate the eyes symmetrically, by means
of visual exploration.  After several unsuccessful attempts, he asked
for advice from the teacher.  The teacher helped him set up a kind of
grid with which he calculated the location of the eyes, and he was
then able to solve this problem without any further difficulty.

Other, more complex problems that Donald encountered in the course of the project
were resolved in similar fashion -- by creating structures which
enabled him to solve the problem analytically and avoid visual
explorations. In the course of his work Donald encountered estimation
of distances and angles, the geometry of arcs and circles, the total
turtle trip theorem, and the use of both grid-based and intrinsic
coordinate systems.  He learned to use subprocedures and
sub-subprocedures, to use patterned procedures making use of a REPEAT
command, to make use of variables to control the size and shape of his
hat and flower and to use a procedure with a conditional stop
rule.  Although Donald only learned these approaches to the extent
necessary to solve the particular problems inherent in his project,
each succeeding use of the same concept reinforced his exposure to it,
deepening his sense of mastery.

Donald's final figure, drawn by the superprocedure, HEAD, represents an
almost literal mapping of his revised plan, figure 11, into a
computer program.

.block 5
0III. Conclusion
.br
1In summary, we observe that Deborah's and Donald's problem solving
styles were markedly different in several ways:
.indent 2
.block 4

01. Planning
.br
1Donald was a planner.  He made an overall plan for his project
and created separate plans for each subpart of his project. Deborah
had an overall idea of what she was trying to accomplish, but her
actual project was carried out in an exploratory manner, one step at a
time.  Donald's superprocedure HEAD, was written to serve as a framework
for his project; Deborah's superprocedure, RABBIT, was written as the
final step in completing her project.

.block 5
02. Analysis vs. Intuition
.br
1Deborah relied on an accurate visual intuition and a very
limited set of inputs to TURTLE commands; Donald's visual intuition was
poor -- he relied on mathematical analysis to resolve each problem he faced.

.block 5
03. Comfort With New Ideas
.br
1Donald absorbed a great deal of new information and tried a
number of new approaches as he carried out his project -- confident
that he could learn the skills he needed as he went along; Deborah
resisted new learning -- her learnings consisted largely of
consolidating and reinforcing old skills and methods.

.block 3
04. Obtaining Assistance From a Teacher
.br
1Donald made regular use of assistance from his teacher, while
Deborah insisted on doing things in her own way, and resisted
suggestions which she did not fully understand.

.indent 0
These observed differences give rise to pedagogical questions that are
not limited to teaching children to use computers:  How can teachers
learn the learning styles of their students?  How can teaching
approaches in normal classes be flexible enough to support such a wide
variation in learning styles?  How can a teacher help Deborah acquire
some of Donald's analytic approach?  Can Deborah's intuitive
understanding be learned by Donald?

The success of both Donald and Deborah in a LOGO environment leads us
to believe that additional experience in such an environment may be
productive in beginning to answer these questions.
