Mathematics is much more than the manipulation of numbers.  At its best, it involves simple, clear examples of thought so apt to the world we live in that those examples provide guidance for our thinking about problems we meet subsequently.  We call such examples, capable of heuristic use, 1POWERFUL IDEAS0.  Here we document a child's introduction to a specific powerful idea in a computer environment and trace his extensions of that idea.  We conclude with a speculative discussion about which aspects of his specific experiences were important in making the powerful idea accessible to the child.

1INTRODUCTION0

0.1 The computer is making its presence widely felt in the education community.  The new availability of computer power to children presents forcefully the question of the computer's role in education.  Here we present a case study of computer-based learning that goes beyond drill-and-practice and game playing to show how particular experiences carried a specific idea of general applicability into a child's mind and how this idea was effective subsequently in his freely-chosen and self-directed problem solving.

0.2 The stepping of variables - by which we mean the development of and the decision to apply a systematic mental procedure for isolating and incrementally changing one of several variables - is an idea of general applicability.  Genevan psychologists have noted this idea as a very important one in that configuration which creates the systematic thought of the formal operational stage [1].  The stepping of variables is the idea whose history we will trace in one child's mind.

0.3 The subject of this case was Robby, my son, eight years old at the time of the study.  With his sister, Miriam, younger by two years, he participated in an intensive six-month study at the Logo Project of the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Intelligence Laboratory [2].  Robby had visited the lab many times in the preceding years and frequently participated in earlier studies [3]. He brought to this work two mental predispositions which are relevant to what follows.  First, he was inclined to call upon symmetry as a generative idea (this observation will be clarified subsequently).  Secondly, his approach to problems was surprisingly systematic for one his age [4].  Before we turn to the case material wherein systematicity plays its role, we must first present some folk-history on the procedures Robby encountered.

1POLYSPIRALS AND VARIABLES0

1.1^^Years ago, a child is a Logo class [5]  invented the SQUIRAL.  In drawing a square maze, the logo turtle (think of this as a freely orientable cursor which may leave a line trace of its path) moves forward, turns a right angle then repeats the actions, with each repetition increasing the distance of the forward move.  A second child discovered, in getting the angle "wrong" while attempting a square maze, that if the turtle turns through an angle near ninety degrees but not equal to it, a four armed spiral emerges from the drawn shape (see the maze and squiral in Figure I). 


1.2^^Emergent phenomena are not mere child's play.  Emergent effects in turtle geometry are very striking.  The generalized procedure developed from the squiral is the POLYSPI [short for polygonal spiral]:

("distance, "angle, and "delta, the global variables referenced in the procedure must be initialized; the result of the recursive invocation of polyspi is to re-execute the procedure another time with the value of the distance variable incremented; the procedure stops when the turtle goes off the edge of the display screen.)  A number of the designs produced by the polyspi procedure from the near-regular polygonal angles are very pretty.  The emergent effects of such designs can be compounded, as by a procedure I composed, MPOLYSPI [short for multiple polyspi], to make even more complex and attractive designs (see the "triangular" polypsi and its six-fold compounding in Figure I).  Emergent effects in turtle geometry cover a range which permits mutual engagement and learning by both children and adults - and thus they became a topic of exploration in many of the research sessions Robby and I spent at the Logo lab.

1.3  Robby's introduction to variables went forward in several small steps.  Initially we played games with a set of labelled match-boxes and card-written commands for changing or examining the contents of the boxes.  We presented the image that global variables were functionally "like" little boxes with contents that one could examine and change by commands of the Logo language.  Consequently, Robby's first use of POLYSPI procedure involved a SETUP procedure whose functions were to clear the display screen of the previous design and to permit his keying of initial values for "distance, "angle, and "delta.  Subsequently, we explained "input variables" as a keying convenience which permit an integrated SETUP procedure.  The form of the POLYSPI with input variables is this:

(Here the incrementing of distance is implicit in the recursive POLYSPI invocation).

1.4  The intellectual challenge implicit in exploring the world of polyspi designs is how to impose some comprehensible order on their considerable variety.  Notice, now, that the POLYSPI procedure with a zero value for delta will draw polygons.  For such polygons drawn with angle values which divide evenly into 360, the polygons are regular; after turning through 360 degrees, the turtle retraces its original path.  In second grade, Robby had learned the names of some geometric figures and the count of their sides.  For example, he knew that a hexagon is a regular polygon of six sides.  When the input angle is that of some regular polygon, e.g. 60, the POLYSPI procedure with small positive values for delta draws figures we called "MAZES".  We distinguished between such mazes and other shapes.  Robby and I together produced a "FAMILY OF MAZES", i.e. a collection of the regular polygonal spirals with three through eight sides.  We printed these designs and displayed them on the wall.  My intention was that individual members of this series of figures could serve as "ANCHORS" for further exploration, both connecting to Robby's previous knowledge of geometric forms and serving as reference bases from which other shapes could seen as variations.

1.5  In the next Logo session on this theme (others intervened), I presented explicitly the objective of developing "FAMILIES OF SHAPES" and showed Robby several examples of such shape families.  The first, reproduced in Figure II, shows six shapes made by incremental change of the MPOLYSPI 122  "folding factor" from one to six.  Thus the single sub-figure, a POLYSPI 122, is repreated an additional time in each of the five successive sub-figures.  Similarly, a second example of a shape family (not shown) displayed changes in the six fold MPOLYSPI 122 as value of delta was reduced from seven to one.  The "lesson" I professed with these examples was that focussing on the systematic changes of a single variable was a fecund method for understanding the results from the complex interaction of several variables.  Whether or not Robby accepted my "lesson" or used what I showed him in another way is an issue will discuss subsequently.

1.6  Robby had the opportunity to construct his own shape family.  I had been careful to leave him the most interesting variable for his changing and proposed building a shape family around one of the mazes as an anchoring value.  Robby selected the hexagonal anchor and enthusiastically created and printed the designs of Figure III, then hung them in order above his desk.  In subsequent sessions, he constructed a shape family anchored at ninety degrees - first increasing the angle value, then, later, (beginning at eighty-five degrees) approaching the anchor from below.  This concluded the didactic phase of Robby's introduction to shape families.

1A POLYSPIRAL VARIATION0

2.1  The increment, "delta, input to the POLYSPI procedure is applied to the first of the two other variables, "distance and "angle.  What happens if delta is applied to augment angle instead of distance ?  Few people have any intuitive response to such a question and most become easily confused in trying to imagine what design would be created by the turtle following commands in such a procedure.  For small values of delta (with an initial angle of zero), the turtle will move off in one direction and gradually spiral into a node.  (For this reason, the procedure was named INSPI by its originator, Marvin Minsky):

(see several examples of basic INSPI designs in Figure IV.)

2.2  When he was first introduced to INSPI designs, Robby's inclination was to vary "angle. After trying INSPI 10/0/2 at my direction, he executed INSPI 10/90/2 (the effect of these parameters, shown in Figure IV, is to alter the origin and orientation of the design.)  When I tried to discuss changing other variables, Robby's personal agenda came forward in comments such as these: "Hold it, Dad, all I want to make it do is go the other way"; "I want it in the exact same direction, but opposite."  After a few false starts, I followed his lead:
.indent 2
.nofill
Robby:^How do you get it to go the other way ?... It goes right.  I want
^^^^^^^to make it go left.
Bob:^^^We'd have to change the A procedure (We had named INSPI "A" because
^^^^^^^it changed angle values).
Robby:^Why don't you make a B procedure, to make it go the other way ?
Bob:^^^Why don't you ?
Robby:^(A complaint) I don't know how !
Bob:^^^You copy the A procedure, but where it says "right" you change it to "left".
.indent 0
.adjust
With the symmetrical procedure created, Robby still inclined to vary "angle".  I intervened to focus his attention on delta as a possibly potent variable.  Robby could not be interested at all, refused to follow my forceful suggestion that he execute INSPI 10/0/7.  Given his refusal, I executed the procedure with those inputs and had the satisfaction of hearing him admit, "I wish I had done that."

2.3  Robby now began to make the symmetrical INSPI designs of FIgure V, using his B procedure with inspi procedure A.  As the complex symmetries of the two-fold INSPI 10/0/7 emerged, he exclaimed, "Isn't that wild !"  I offered 11 as the next delta candidate.  After printing out the second symmetrical design, I proposed (would that I had bit my tongue) this speculation:
.ss
.indent 2
.nofill
Bob:^^^Why don't you try the next prime number ?  It turns out -
^^^^^^^and I never would have guessed it - that prime numbers --
Robby:^(Interrupting) Do this ? (Referring to the symmetrical INSPI 10/0/11.) 
Bob:^^^Why don't you give 13 a try ?... I'm not quite sure, but that's my
^^^^^^^speculation, anyway.  I'm sorry I told you that.  Maybe I should have
^^^^^^^let you have the chance to figure that out.
Robby:^Yeah....but I don't know the prime numbers very well.

.ss
.indent 0
.adjust
After executing the symmetrical INSPI 13's, Robby concluded, "Everytime we do it, they're getting super-er."  We conclude that Robby's strong confidence in the heuristic of pursuing symmetries in design was amply confirmed.  This use of a heuristic is one clearly focussed on the objective of generating interesting designs.  If there were any motive to better understand these INSPI designs through symmetry it must have been relatively insignificant compared to the former.

2.4  My uncertain speculation that "primes" had something to do with creating interesting designs [5] inspired Robby to produce a complete set of symmetrical INSPI designs for all the primes between seven and fifty.  One might imagine he did so because he is a suggestible boy and easily led.  The opposite is more nearly true.  Two examples stand out.  At my direction, he tried some large value deltas.  When I called his attention to the puzzle of the minimal design (a small straight line) made with the initial zero angle and delta 180, Robby continued from there with elegant symmetrical designs, based on delta values of 187 and 206, then decided, "I think I'll go back to using primes."  After producing designs for delta values of twenty-nine and thirty-one, he decided thirty-three was not a prime and rejected it as a candidate value.  Knowing that thirty-three would produce an interesting design, I pushed him to try it,  but he refused, "No.  I'm going to use only primes."  He then figured out the values of primes thirty-seven, forty-one, forty-three, and forty-seven and completed  his own creation - the family of symmetrical, prime-based INSPI designs.

2.5  What do we make of this material ?  Most obvious is that the world of experience confirmed the value of Robby's heuristic, "try symmetry", as a generator of pretty designs. Second is that even though the INSPI procedures led to results less intuitively accessible than those produced by the POLYSPI procedures, Robby explored this world of INSPI designs in a systematic way that amounted to a first extension of the idea of variable stepping.  That is, Robby settled on delta as the most potent variable for these designs and followed my "prime-hypothesis" to generate the next candidate delta value for creating a design.  I believe we can infer that his experience of this INPSI-world confirmed the value of stepping variables as a heuristic. 

2.6^^The symmetry heuristic is good for generating designs; what is stepping variables good for ?  Did Robby appreciate this as a second heuristic for generating pretty pictures or did he see it as a way of organizing the world to better understand it ?  This distinction is one thatwe make, one that we might call upon in judging a possible claim that Robby learned a heuristic that is good for some specific purpose.  I believe rather that Robby learned a heuristic that was specific with respect to activity but vague with respect to purpose; that, although he may have begun to apply the heuristic to generate interesting results, the actual outcome for him was the better comprehension of something worthwhile understanding (in terms of his judgment of what was worthwhile).  This point is illustrated in the final incident reported here.

1BEYOND THE LABORATORY0

3.1  Because Robby lives with me, it has been my privledge to observe how these experiences at Logo were reflected in his later problem solving.   Some six months after our study at the Logo project, a parent visiting his third grade class introduced to Robby the PAPER-RINGS puzzle.  This is a bit of topological magic; it leads the the "squaring" of two circles.  (It is a puzzle in the sense of creating a surprising result.)  I recommend you try it.  Here's how it's done:
.indent 2
.nofill
.block 5
1.^Cut two paper strips of equal length (eight inches will do).
2.^Draw a line down the middle of each.
3.^Bend each strip of paper into a circle and tape the juncture.
4.^Join the circles at tangents perpendicularly and tape the juncture.
5.^Cut around the middle line drawn on each circle.
.indent 0
.adjust				
(When two strips of equal length are so connected and cut, the surprising result is that the strip-halves end up taped together as a square.)

3.2  Robby enjoyed this activity when shown it.  Several days later, I removed a pattern of strips  he had made from a paper on my clip-board. When I interrupted his reading to give him the sheet of paper, Robby recalled the game and quietly took it up on his own.  He was very happy when the procedure produced a square and showed it to his mother and me.  We neither paid much attention.  Going on to three circles, Robby cut two of the three along their mid-lines.  He judged (in error) that he had finished by finding a square with a bar (a double width strip) across the center.  It lay flat.  Still no one paid attention.  He went on to four circles.  When he cut all the mid-lines, what he got was a confusion of flopping paper strips.  I advised him to try getting it to lie flat.  He was delighted when he achieved this goal and subsequently taped the paper strips to a large piece of cardboard.  The resulting shape is this:

But why stop at four ?  Robby went on to cut and connect five circles.  When cut, the five circles separated into two identical, non-planar shapes.  He taped these to another piece of cardboard.  When he tried to tape the floppy figures made from cutting six rings, Robby succeeded with great effort.  He decided the problem was getting too complicated to be much fun and quit.

^^^^^After I recalled his attention to the figure made by cutting two of the three circles and  pointed out that the middle bar of his figure was double-thick, Robby agreed he had cut only two circles.  He saw immediately that this square would divide into two rectangles, "The five's made two too.  Hey ! I've got a new theory: the odd-numbered circles make two and the evens all stay together."  Robby could not prove his conjecture, but in the course of our discussion when I asked how he had gotten the idea of this exploration, he explained, "Dad, it's just like what we did at Logo with the shape families.  I changed one thing, a little at a time."  


3.3  Robby's explanation witnesses that he conceived of his exploration in terms of that past Logo experience.  This does not imply that the Logo shape families marked his first encounter with or use of the idea of controlled changing of a single variable.  We may infer, nonetheless, that he owned an example of this idea crisply applied to a complex but comprehensible range of interesting phenomena, and further, that it did provide him guidance for thinking about a problem met subsequently.  He appreciated his Logo shape families experience as embodying a powerful idea. Did he apply the heuristic because it might generate new results or because it might help him understand a range of puzzling phenomena ?   I conclude he used this heuristic to generate interesting results in a comprehensible way.  The two aspects of purpose we might distinguish appear to be inextricable in this case.   Finally, I suggest that this sort of systematic exploration is a typical precursor of the hypothesis-driven experimentation which Genevan psychologists argue is the sine qua non of formal operational thought.  

.ri
1INTERPRETATION0
.ds
4.1^^We have provided here an example of the educational use of computers that goes beyond drill-and-practice and game-playing to the adoption of an idea of great generality.  The incremental change of an isolated variable, variable stepping, is a heuristic, a useful method for exploring a new domain of experience.  We will now ask "What sort of thing is this heuristic ?" and "What led to its salience in Robby's later problem solving ?"  The empirical evidence is too anecdotal and highly interpreted to be coercive; we intend here no more than a plausible conjecture.  The basic position I want to advance is that specific characteristics of Robby's experience permitted him to see the construction of shape families as sensible and further that they also account for the salience of the way of seeing problems we describe by the verbal heuristic formulation: "isolate a variable; change it a step at a time".

4.2 I describe in other places [7] cognitive structures called MICROWORLDS.  For our purposes here we can think of microworlds as what is constructed in the mind in consequence of the individual's activity in a specific mini-world of experience under the influence of prior, ANCESTRAL, microworlds.  Microworlds are of two parts: PERSPECTIVES specify "What's what", i.e. what the mind can appreciate as the significant elements in the experience; FUNCTIONS are the transformations that can happen to those elements which  the perspective specifies as significant.  The functions may be represented as procedures or as well-known-results (compiled procedures).  Which of the three kinds of knowledge is most significant ?  I believe that perspectives are.   While I admit, for example, that it is worthwhile to memorize "addition facts" and useful to develop procedures of mental calculation,  I hold it is more significant to appreciate the role of place value in the hindu-arabic representation of number.  (None of these aspects of knowledge can develope independently of the others, however.) The perspective is one's window-on-the-world; it specifies the terms in which one can try to make sense of experience.

4.3  Microworlds, as described so far, are rooted in the experience of mini-worlds.  But other kinds of microworlds, of similar structure but somewhat different function, are important in the organization of mind.  One type, control microworlds, function in solving problems by invoking others.  (The functions of such microworlds are limited to the routing of perspective element values to subordinated worlds.)  A second type, mapping worlds, has no functions at all: such a perspective comprises correspondences between the perspective elements of other microworlds.  The third type of microworld, special in character but not so in structure or function, as such, is the archetype.  What is special about the archetypical microworld is locality of reference.  What does this mean ?  In general, microworlds are able to invoke the knowledge of ancestral worlds from which they have descended.  LOCALITY OF REFERENCE means a microworlds can be an archetype if (among other things) functions are constrained to intra-world transformations.  The "other things" include: direct connection of perspective elements to ancient knowledge for their initial complete definition; crisp distinction between microworld elements so that their discriminating assignment is uncomplicated; a regular correlation between specific operand elements and the operations performable on them.  Under these constraints, prediction (stepwise speculation) can proceed with inference chains of minimal length, i.e. minimal inference implies that from "what's what" "what follows" in "intuitively obvious".  In such a case, the logic of the world is "necessary" and involves no invocation of any subordinate structures.  The claim then is that turtle geometry, as represented by Robby's POLYSPI FAMILIES experiences, fulfills the characteristics of an archetypical microworld.  If a new relationship is perceived between the elements of an archetypical microworld, this is significant because the archetype can function as a new seed of genesis for future experience-based microworlds.  The virtue of locality of reference is in establishing a new plateau of thought, a new level of cognitive primitives, in this case, variable stepping.


4.4  We can see by inspection how the characteristics of the POLYSPI experience justify the claim of archetypical status for the microworld constructed in Robby's mind: in general, the experience of turtle geometry is accesssible to children because they can simulate with their own body-knowledge of movement the actions which the turtle performs; the crisp distinction between linear distance and a rotation is clear; the regular coupling of moving with linear distance and rotation with turning is  also clear.  What is further significant is that within this archetyypical world, Robby could appreciate a new method for making sense of complex interactions.  What we see as a heuristic is a new level of thought a-borning.  The power of the idea is that stepping variables is, in fact, a very useful way to explore our common world.  What gave it salience in Robby's mind was its exemplification in the experience domain of an archetypical microworld.  The POLYSPI SHAPE FAMILY microworld is genetically the ancestor of the structure (either ephemeral or permanent) derived from Robby's play with the paper rings puzzle.  To the extent that other microworlds, similar to the later, will in the future derive directly from the archetypical POLYSPI SHAPE FAMILY world, that microworld will serve as the nucleus of a cluster of worlds developed from "seeing" the world in the terms of that archetype.
