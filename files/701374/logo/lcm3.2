SYSTEM MECHANICS

.fi b
This booklet provides information you will need for using
the keyboard, editing LOGO procedures, saving procedures and shapes on
cassette and recalling them from a cassette.
.bp
.chapter "bold(Using the Keyboard)"
The computer keyboard is like an electric typewriter which allows you to communicate
with the computer.  Like a typewriter it prints each character you type 
but it prints out on the TV screen.  
The blinking cursor shows you where the next character will appear.  Some keys have
other special functions.

To send a command to the computer
.br
type the  ENTER key.

To erase one character, or move the cursor back one space
.br
type SHIFT-U
.br
(When using the SHIFT-key, hold down the shift first, then type the other
key.)

WARNING!!  DO NOT TYPE SHIFT-Q
.br
This will restart the computer, erasing all your procedures.

Other special keys are used to edit procedures or create sprite and
tile shapes.  These will be described in the appropriate section.

The LOGO comand, CS or CLEARSCREEN will  clear
all text from the screen.

.chapter "bold(LOGO Typing Hints)"
Every computer language has its own special rules which can be confusing when you
are learning to use it.  When you type something the computer does not understand
it will complain by sending you an error message. Following a few simple procedures
you can avoid some typing difficulties.

1.  Always leave a space after a LOGO command or input (except at the
end of a line.)  The computer needs a space after every word to avoid confusion,
just as we leave a space after a word in English.

Examples
.br
Type	TELL	0	not	TELL0

Type	SETCOLOR	:RED	not	 SETCOLOR:RED

2.  When using an input name such as   :RED,  think of the : as the first "letter"
of the name.  The color or "dots" tells the computer to find the number associated
with the name.  (Never leave a space after the   :   .)

Type	SETCOLOR	:RED	not	SETCOLOR:   RED
				or	SETCOLOR   :   RED

.keep
3.  Don't use  :  when typing numbers.

Type 	SETCOLOR   6	 not	 SETCOLOR   :6
.end_keep

4.  Explore what happens when you make a typing mistake by
trying to type some buggy commands.

.nf l
.keep
Examples:
TELL0
SETC:   RED
CARRY   :   PLANE
SETS   :10
.end_keep

.chapter "bold(Using the LOGO Editor)"
The LOGO text editor makes it easy to change or define a procedure.
You can use special editing keys to:

- add something to a line
.br
- rub out and change part of a line
.br
- erase an entire line
.br
- add a new line


To change an existing procedure type ED, or EDIT followed by the procedure
name:

	ED   DANCE      or      EDIT   DANCE

After a few seconds the computer will display the text of the procedure, DANCE.

.nf L
.keep
.in 2i
TO   DANCE
SETS    10      WAIT    20
SETS   -10      WAIT    20
RT    15
DANCE
END
.end_keep
.in

.fi b
The red object under the letter T is called the edit cursor.  You can change DANCE by
moving the cursor and using editing commands.

bold(Commands to Move the Cursor)
 
You can move the cursor using shift, and the arrow keys.

.nf L
.keep
	Shift-			s(m)moves cursor up one line
	Shift-			t(m)moves cursor down one line
	Shift-			t(m)moves cursor left one space
	Shift-			t(m)moves the cursor right one space
	Shift-A			t(m)moves the cursor back to the beginning 
				t(m)of a line
.end_keep

.keep
bold(Editing Commands)

	Shift-T			t(m)erases the character above the cursor
	Shift-C			t(m)erases everything on a line to the right
				     of the cursor
	Shift-V			t(m)inserts a blank line and moves the existing
				     line down one space.
.end_keep
.keep
	Shift-U			t(m)rubs out the character behind the cursor,
				     just as it does when you are typing normal LOGO
				     commands. 
	Enter			t(m)moves the cursor down to the beginning of
				     the next line.  If there is any text to
				     the right of the cursor it will be moved too.
.end_keep

When you are finished editing type:
	Shift-F
After a few seconds the computer will print:
	DONE!   THANK YOU FOR WAITING.

.fi b
Here is an example to try if you want to practice using the editor.
Let's change the procedure DANCE so that a sprite turns 30 degrees each
time, and add a line, changing a sprite's color.

.keep
1.  If you have not already done so, type  ED   DANCE.  DANCE will now
appear on the screen:

.nf L
.in 2i
TO   DANCE			
SETS    10     WAIT    20
SETS   -10     WAIT    20
RT   15
DANCE
END
.end_keep
.in

2.  Move the cursor down using shift-@@@@@ until it is under the  R  of  RT:

.keep
.in 2i
TO   DANCE
SETS    10     WAIT    20
SETS   -10     WAIT    20
RT   15
DANCE
END
.end_keep
.in

3.  Move the cursor to the right using shift-@@@@@so that it is  under the  1:

.in 1i
RT    15
.in

4.  Replace the  15  by  30.  There are several ways:

.keep				
a)  Type shift-T twice:
.in 1i
RT    15
RT    5
RT    @@@
.in
Then type 30:
.in 1i
RT    3@@@
RT    30@@@
.end_keep
.in

.keep
b)  Type shift-C:
.in 1i
RT    15
RT    @@@      t(m)The rest of the line has been deleted.  
.in
Then type 30.
.end_keep

.keep
c)  Type 30:
.in 1i
RT    15	t(m)As 30 is inserted into the text, both the cursor
RT    315 	t(m)and the remaining text are moved two spaces to
RT    3015 	t(m)the right.
.in
.end_keep
.fi b
Now type shift-C or shift-T twice, to eliminate the  15.
.in 1i
RT    30@@@
.in

To add a line which changes a sprite's color, first decide where the line
should be placed in the procedure.  It could go just before the RT   30
command.
.br
The procedure now looks like this:
.keep
.nf L
.in 2i

TO   DANCE
SETS    10     WAIT   20
SETS   -10     WAIT   20
RT   30@@
DANCE
END
.end_keep
.in

.keep
5.  Use shift-A to move the cursor back to the beginning of the line:

.in 2i
TO   DANCE
SETS    10     WAIT   20
SETS   -10     WAIT   20
RT   30
DANCE
END
.end_keep
.in

.keep
6.  Shift-V inserts a new line and moves the existing line down one space:

.in 2i
TO   DANCE
SETS    10     WAIT   20
SETS   -10     WAIT   20
@@@
RT   30
DANCE
END
.end_keep
.in

.keep
7.  Type in the new command on the blank line:

.in 2i
TO   DANCE
SETS    10    WAIT    20
SETS   -10    WAIT    20
SETC    COLOR   +   1@@@
RT    30
DANCE
END
.end_keep
.in

To finish editing type shift-F.
.br
Now type DANCE and see how the procedure behaves differently.1

Further Information About the Editor
.br
0It is possible to start writing a procedure with the editor, by typing
EDIT.  The computer will then display a blank screen, on which you can
define a procedure in the usual way by typing  TO   FOO, etc.
.end_keep

You can define more than one procedure at a time, using the editor.  After
typing END, go on to define another procedure in the usual way.

WARNING!!! If your typing goes beyond the bottom of the screen, any lines you type will
be lost.

.chapter "bold(Saving and Recalling Information)"
.section "bold(Saving Your Procedures and Shapes on Cassette)"
Once you have taught the computer some new procedures or created some
new
shapes you may want to save them, so that you can use the procedures
and shapes at a later date.

First, make sure the cassette reorder is properly connected to the
computer, as
shown in the figure:
.bp
Second, Make sure the tone and volume controls of the cassette
recorder are set properly.  Set the tone to 9 and set the volume to 7.
These settings work for a panasonic RQ-2309A cassette recorder.  If you
have a different kind of recorder you will have to experiment to find the
proper setting.

Third, insert a tape in the recorder.  If you use an old tape, be sure
that it does not contain procedures that you want to keep.  When you
save
your current procedures, any other information stored on the tape will
be lost.

Now, type SAVE

Once you type SAVE, the computer will ask you questions and give
instructions.
The computer will ask you three questions.

SAVE  YOUR  WORKSPACE (Y or N)	s(m)You respond by typing Y for "yes"
.br
SAVE  YOUR  SPRITES (Y or N)	t(m)or N for "No" for each question.
.br
SAVE  YOUR  TILES (Y or N)

Your workspace is all your procedures and names.  Your sprites are any
sprite shapes you may have invented.  Your tiles are any tile shapes
you may have created.

After answering the questions, follow the directions printed by the
computer.

REWIND  CASSETTE  TAPE  CS1
.BR
THEN  PRESS  ENTER

PRESS  CASSETTE  RECORD  CS1
.BR
THEN  PRESS  ENTER

After the tape has been running for some time -- possibly 5 minutes
or more, the computer will print,

PRESS  CASSETTE  STOP  CS1
.BR
THEN  PRESS  ENTER

.section "bold(Recalling Information)"
To read information from a tape into the computer's memory, type
RECALL,
and follow the directions printed by the computer.  The connections
and settings are the same as for using SAVE to store information on
the cassette.
