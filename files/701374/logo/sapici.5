hi seymour:  sorry to bother you with an extra file--I didnt
want to risk somehow destroying the main file.  The
following corrections should be clear.  I dont feel very
good about the section describing data from the four tasks,
even when more clearly described.  Dan, apparently, doesnt
want the section at all.  Given the proposal and the
function of the overview chapter I would think it unwise to
delete the section.  Talk to you later.  Happy Independence
Day [sic]!  john

p.1  The sixteenth student, Karl, had no score because,
according to his record, he had not been tested due to
"severe learning problems."
[Dan's correction]

p.5  The children were encouraged to keep a written record
of their steps which they later used to "teach" these same
steps to the computer.  Thus, procedure writing was
introduced.

p.13  [Description of Tasks]

     In Task 1, students were shown a line and told its
length in units that corresponded to turtle steps as
represented on their display.  They were the asked to
estimate the length of other lines which were drawn in
various orientations.  <sentence on drawing lines of their
own>
...
     In Task 3, students were presented with a series
including backward and forward steps and asked, using
whatever means they chose (e.g. sketching, arithmetic) to
describe the turtle movement in terms of a single step.(see
figures 1.4 and 1.5)  Improvement in this task might
indicate gains in understanding additive and inverse
properties of number.

NB  [it seems that paragraph 2 under "description of tasks"
beginning "The eigth student..." has somehow lost its place
as an afterthought to "Analysis of Interview Data" where it
belongs]

I hope that does it.  I'm not sure my handling of tenses in
the teaching methods/strategies sections is satisfactory.  I
tried to use simple past for discrete past activities and
past conditional to correspond to imparfait.  On rereading,
however, I see that it's pretty irregular.

Am working on an agenda for Thursday meeting.  Will talk to
you.

p.s. If you want to see a rough of some text for the
introduction to the manual (very rough), it is in logo;
