FORCED MOVES -- Miriam's defensive play in games of form M1 shows her
achieving a tie by following a sequence of forced moves.  The inference
I draw is that when she fails to make a forced move it is because
she is pursuing some non-defensive objective (as is clearly the case
in game 1.5).
GAME KNOWLEDGE -- Miriam knew well that achieving a fork guarantees
victory.  She knew of one specific forking pattern, the three corner fork.
There is no evidence that she knew of any other.  In offensive play,
Miriam was capable of an expert win in opening form M2, apparently
without recognizing tha fork her procedure effected.  Her expert wins 
in form M2 do not necessarily indicate that she was even aware
of the forks her play established.  She showed no knowledge
of possible expert wins with openings C1 and C2.  Her defensive
play showed no appreciation that the side response to a middle opening
is a pitfall (form M2) as is the adjacent corner response to a corner
opening form C3).
REPRESENTATION -- Miriam did not represent a fork as two intersecting
"ways-to-win", i.e. her representation of the three corner fork did not
include "what isn't there", the requirement that specific cells be
empty.  This judgment (based on game 1.5) is reinforced by Miriam's
attempt to block the three corner fork by seizing corner cells (game 2.3).
RIGIDITY -- Whenever Miriam embarked on a corner opening, she expected
or, better, desperately hoped that one particular game would result 
(the successful trap of form C5).  Games 1.4 and 2.4 show she had no idea
of how to counter an opposite corner response to a corner opening.
LEARNING FROM AN OPPONENT'S PLAY -- After suffering herself
two different ways of frustrating the three corner fork, Miriam
applied neither as a defense against it.

           Two Games Representing Others As Well
.ds

.adjust
0Whenever Miriam initiated a game with a middle opening and I responded with
a side cell, she won.  She did not refer to these games as involving "tricks"
of any sort.  I gradually altered my responses to a regular corner cell response.
Neither of us making any mistakes, we can inevitably to a draw.

     The basic representational challenge is to relate a cognitive structure
to the recorded play in such a way that the functioning of the structure
"explains" the observed behavior.  I choose the representation set forth in
Figure 1-1.  Somehow is presented QUERY, a question, "What move next?", and information
(the markers already in place in the grid) to those structures which determine behavior.
Miriam did not attempt to make every move, only those of her turn.  This obvious
fact requires some control element, represented by "TURNS", which inhibits taking
the opponent's turn.  Since the choice of who moves first is a special case of
whose move is next, it seems appropriate to cluster those questions together.

     What happens when it is not the opponent's turn ?  Control passes
to a cluster of structures I call microworlds.  Each microworld responds to
a situation it can recognize.  The "recognition part" of a microworld is its
PERSPECTIVE.  When a pattern is recognized, a slot in the perspective is
filled. When the associated perspective slots are filled, the functions of a
microworld are activated and they execute, proposing an action.  For example,
in a microworld which blocks an opponent's winning, the recognition of the threat
implicit in opponent's markers in cells 1 and 4  results in proposing a move to cell 7.  Such a proposed move is effected if it is uncontested.

     What happens when more than one threat is recognized (as in a fork) or
when a threat-blocking proposal confronts a proposal to win the game by a 
different move ?  The answer to this question is a mixture of representation
choice and empirical observation.  I choose (for reasons which will appear
subsequently) to represent the structures which respond stepwise to developing
games as a set of three competing microworlds. One (WIN) recognizes ways to
to win.  A second (BLOCK) recognizes opponent's threats. The third (POSITION)
directs the next move when neither a win is immediately possible nor a threat
is recognized.  If three such microworlds compete with each other in responding
to a specific QUERY ( as I assume they do), the factors which affect that
competition and the functions within the POSITION-world are to be empirically
determined.

     Consider now, as an example of how such microworlds might interact in the
stepwise play of the two games below:2

      D              WIN          game lost
.ds
.adjust

0Notice that the Block-world activated in the C-move of the a-first game could 
have recognized the two threats of the fork and either proposed conflicting moves
to block both or failed (in such a case, producing nothing but a complaint that two moves would be required because it could not produce an uncontested proposal).  In either case, the controlling structure TURNS would resolve the conflict.

     A further note to make worthy distinction is between the reactive worlds (WIN and BLOCK) and the proactive world POSITION.  Given the distinction, the proposed action of the POSITION world might appear to be more  than a simple response to a recognized pattern.  For example, the functions of the POSITION world could be seen as a set of serially executed conditional rules such as:
.nofill
.ss
.indent 5
1. propose a middle move if possible.
2. propose a corner move is possible.
3. propose a side cell move.

.ds
.adjust
.indent 0
We choose to represent the internal structure of the POSITION world by a preference grid becaue that better fits the later appearing observations. The objectives of a microworld comprise the third major aspect of their  structure.  The objective of POSITION is not, in any sense, a strategic plan.   Its character is more tactical and answers such questions as "Given the present configuration of markers, where should I place my next marker to enhance my position ?"  These microworlds, taken together, will be refered to as the TACTICAL CLUSTER, taking their name from the character of the  POSITION world objective.
     Does this proposed structure suffice to produce the behavior exhibited by
the representative games 1.1 and 1.2 ?  I believe it does, if we admit other
influences at the level of control of the TURNS frame.  Two important sources 
of influence on underlying structures are social suggestion and boredom.  Even
given that POSITION would propose a corner move before a side cell move, a social
challenge, e.g. "Why do you always move in a corner ?" could lead to the
TURNS frame rejecting corner move proposals with the resulting side move manifest
in behavior.
     The structure of Figure 1.1 is where we begin.  Let us now procede to elaborate
the structure by deepening the material to better align the model with the more
complex behavior manifest at the beginning of the study.

ARGUMENT
Here is described the striking incident through which corner openings entered
Miriam's repertoire. On the limits and the separateness of corner opening play
from the structures of stepwise play.
.ds
.adjust

     When our games of form M1 regularly ended in a draw, Miriam began a new gambit,
the first move corner choice.  A little background information will illuminate 
the role of corner openings in Miriam's play.

     Several years ago I bought Miriam's brother Robby a Tic Tac Toe game.  
I introduced playing to both children.  Miriam, then aged four, learned that one 
took turns and that winning was getting three counters in a row.  I taught Robby
one element of strategy: look for "two ways to win".  Robby was able to absorb
the instructiuon easily enough, but Miriam could not.  They played with different
competences: Robby winning with his strategy: Miriam winning frequently enough
when he made errors to be satisfied.  As Robby came to make fewer errors, they
played less and the game dropped from their repertoire of favorites.

     Shortly before the beginning of The Intimate Study, I visited the Boston
Children's Museum with Miriam, Robby and his friend John.  One incident that
occurred there made a tremendous impression on both Miriam and John and has
markedly influenced all her subsequent play.  John and Miriam both played Tic
tac toe against the Museum computer with openings M1 and M2.  When they fell in
pitfall of a side response to the computer's middle opening, they were regularly
defeated.  The computer always responded in the corner to their middle openings,
so the children's best game was no better than a draw.  Eventually Robby got a turn
(the others peering over his shoulder) and opened with a corner move.  The game
unfolded as one of form C5, and Robby won.  John and Miriam were astounded.
Robby clearly owned some powerful knowledge.  Since he was glad to share that
knowledge with them, the three corner fork entered Miriam's repertoire and has
exerted a dominant influence in the development of her play.  Tic tac toe emerged
a game of frequent choice as the Intimate Study began. This incident shows a case where a socially current but uncomprehended formulation ("look for two ways to win") was given a personal meaning by the close observation and imitation of another's striking performance.
     The remaining games of session one were three where Miriam introduced corner openings:2
.ss

          A                A                A     
        A | c | C        A |   |          A | b | C 
        -----------      -----------      -----------
      1.3    | a | D   1.4    |   |     1.5    | c |

         C 5              C 1              C 2    

.ds
.adjust
0Game 1.3 duplicated the play by which Robby had defeated the Museum's computer.
What became increasingly surprising as I probed her play was Miriam's rigidity 
in this form.  When Miriam confronted an opposite corner response to a corner
opening in game 1.4, she did not know how to proceed at all.  Her response was
primarily social: she complained loud and long.  Eventually she moved with no
coherent objective.  A simple description of Miriam's play would be this:
.ss
.nofill
.indent 5
objective: occupy three corners
procedure:
.indent 7
1. occupy the upper left corner (cell 1)
2. occupy the opposite corner (cell 9)
3. occupy the upper right corner (cell 3)
.ds
.indent 0
.adjust

Miriam's inability to counter an opposite corner response in game 1.4 would reflect having no flexability in the steps of her procedure (and, of course, that she had no knowledge of the expert win for game C1).  Game 1.5 shows Miriam continuing with a three corner fork objective despite move "b" rendering the fork completely ineffective.  Either she did not consider the potential moves (the "holes" which help define a forking pattern) as essential parts of the fork or her objective did not regard at all the opponent's play.
     How should games 1.3 - 1.5 lead us to alter the structure of
Figure 1.1 ?  Should we merely assume that boredom led the TURNS frame to
reject middle openings ?  The answer must be "no", and for at least
two reasons.  First, the objective of the CORNERS microworld (for so
we will declare this other structure to be) is different in kind from
the stepwise tactical objectives which determine the functions of the
POSITION world.  We will call the objective a strategic one because it
aims at nothing less than winning the game through achieving a specific 
fork.  Secondly, the CORNERS-world does not interact with the three
competing microworlds of the stepwise cluster, i.e. the objectives of POSITION and CORNERS show alternative modes of play.  More specifically,  in games 1.5, the BLOCK-world function of blocking an opponent's threat did not operate.  In game 1.4, Miriam refused to continue play, i.e. she	 did not seek to enhance her position.  A critic might raise these questions: "Didn't she win game 1.3 ?  Doesn't that implicate some sort of connection with the WIN microworld ?"  Not so, for the character of the processes of winning is not uniform.  In the WIN-world, the perspective recognizes an unforced way to win among the patterns of various markers, while the victory achieved by the three corner gambit is pre-established as one of the two alternatives implicit in the fork.  It is little more than the immediate  consequence of achieving the CORNERS-world objective.  The more elaborate structure is diagrammed in Figure 1.2

ARGUMENT
Miriam's play against her brother shows that her three corner objective
is focussed on the number of corners occupied, not on the positional
significance of markers.  When her functional resources are exhausted,
she negotiates and cheats.  These acts are related to knowledge in the
TURNS frame.

.ds
     In games 1.4 and 1.5, Miriam suffered two defenses against her three
corner objectives.  In games against Robby, she did not adapt either of
those specific moves.  Instead of learning  her opponent's strategems 
from her own defeat, she attemptsed victory by negotiation.2

(It is possible these games are recorded "upside down" from Miriam's point of view.  This is likely given that the children played on opposite sides of the grid and that Robby moved first.) Game 2.1 finds Miriam victim of a three corner fork.  Although her second move denies one corner to her opponent, Miriam's opening response indicates she had no dominant objective of denying corners as a defensive ploy. (Contrast this with game 2.3).  It is possible Miriam moved in cell 5 because the second player is "supposed to" do so.  In game 2.2 Miriam tried to avoid going first (in her turn) because she believed Robby would block her attempt to occupy three corners: "I'm afraid he will take the place I want to go.  I won't get two ways to win."  In that game, of opening form M1, the appearance of traps being set (by move B) is more likely is an accident of her avoiding the frustration of her three corner objective.  Her attempt to block the three corner fork in game 2.3 obviously focusses on the number of corners occupied and not on their configuratiuon as a representation
of threats.  That is, while she pursues play focussed on corners, Miriam did not block her opponent's way to win.  This argues for significant separation between the play of the CORNERS world and the competing microworlds of the tactical cluster.  Given recognition of the social context of her play, all these games follow moves that would derive from the model of Figure 1-2.

     Miriam's fear that her corner opening strategy will be blocked results in an
attempt to negotiate a victory in game 2.4:
.ss
.nofill
.indent 1
Miriam:  Are you going to block me ?
Robby:   No.
Miriam:  (Puts marker in upper left corner - A1).
Robby:   (Puts marker in lower right corner - a1).
Miriam:  (Shifts her marker to lower left corner - A2).
Robby:   You took your hand off it ! (an outraged complaint.)

.ds
.adjust
.indent 0

Miriam's concern is that Robby not block her diagonal pattern (by foiling her use
of cell 9 for her B marker).  Her switching to the adjacent corner is an attempt
to avoid his blocking of her second step.  The explosive disagreement which followed
game 2.4 ended their play for the day and up through session 14.

     Two further challenges rise from the observations of this session.  How shall we think
about the negotiating and cheating ?  How should we represent the opponent-specific	
knowledge that is so salient in play against her brother ?  Since the attempt to
negotiate alternate winning and the cheating of game 2.4 are both violations of
turn taking expectations, both these behaviors should be related to the TURNS
frame.  When the microworld's resources are exhausted, the problem is returned to 
a higher level of control.  There is no place in the microworld's internal 
structure for the kind of knowledge Miriam expressed about Robby's play, i.e.
that he could prevent her from winning and would do so.  Miriam's knowledge of
his knowledge could not reach beyond what she knew herself.  (Indeed, she ascribes
to him the only strategy she owns.  This is appropriate, in fact, since what she learned 
of the three corner fork came from observing his play at the Children's Museum.)
Further, her fear he would prevent her getting "two-ways-to-win",i.e. block her
three corner fork, led her to modify her play significantly,  to abandon her
only offensive strategy for position enhancing tactics in 2.2.  The conclusion I infer is that Miriam's anticipation of Robby's play functioned through the frame to influence which of the two modes of play she followed.  That is, the tactical and strategic modes do not compete between themselves in the same sense as do microworlds of the stepwise cluster; not merely do they not interact, they are distinct alternatives between which a choice is made based upon the frame linked knowledge about "social" aspects of her opponent's play.  The objectives influencing which cluster of microworlds is activated are shown in the diagram of Figure 2-1 which completes the initial characterization of Miriam's Tic tac toe related structures at the beginning of The Intimate Study.

SYNOPSIS0

.twinch 5
FORCED MOVES -- Between game 3.1 and 5.5, Miriam made all forced moves.
In fact, she made too many (games 3.8, 4.8 and 5.3).  In these games,
Miriam initially executed a forced move instead of achieving a win.
GAMES KNOWLEDGE -- The most striking revelation of Miriam's
knowledge state is the description of her objectives in game 4.2.  
The objective is defined by the pattern of the three corner fork.  She
considered neither the initiator's advantage nor the ways her opponent
could block her plan.  Miriam encountered several new opening forms
during these sessions, but with the focus on table turning and on
forced moves, in repsect of these game forms it is clear that although
she had the experience she missed its significance.
REPRESENTATION -- The contrast of games 5.4 and 5.5 shows that
Miriam was sensitive to the role of forks in winning play.  The counters
were more salient to her than the "holes".  None of this is new.  Although
Miriam can recognize and take advantage of forks she has not planned, she
also fails to recognize forks already achieved.
RIGIDITY -- To the extent that Miriam became aware of the forks
which were the basis of wins in opening M2, her play became less rigid.
Her developing ability to abandon a three corner objective in the face
of a forced move is a second advance in flexibility.
LEARNING FROM AN OPPONENT'S PLAY -- Three series of games (3.1-3.3, 
3.6-3.8, and 5.3-5.5) show Miriam's development from a refusal to turn
the tables through its acceptance to a possible early case of the
technique's spontaneous use.

     During the sessions represented by games sets three through nine,
Miriam was under instruction.  Though didactic with respect to my intentions,
these sessions were in no way formal.  The typical situation would place
Miriam in my lap; we would have just finished "doing some adding" and at
her request had taken up Tic tac toe.  Miriam provided most direction in
these sessions.  My instruction was usually a response to and a reflection
upon some immediately preceding action of hers.  My two general objectives
were to help Miriam understand and fix those faux pas -- those mis-steps
of her procedures -- and to develop her ablity to learn from an opponent.
     Miriam's apprenticeship -- defined more by my didactic intentions
than by any action or attitude of hers -- extended over four month's time.
I began as a casual player; no one should be surprised that my view of
Tic tac toe changed during this period.  With respect to the instruction
I offered Miriam, game sets three through five reflect the everyday view
of Tic tac toe.  Beginning with game set 6, my thinking and instruction
were dominated by the opening oriented view.
     Despite this varying perspective on the CONTENT on instruction, the
METHOD of instruction continually revolved around the idea of TURNING THE
TABLES on an opponent.  By turning the tables, I mean this sequence of events:
.ss
.nofill
.indent 1
1. Whenever Miriam lost a game or found a strategy frustrated,
2. we replayed that game with the roles of initiator and opponent reversed
3. so that she could copy and actively execute the winning procedure
4. during which re-execution we could (but did not always) discuss each move
and verify that she was copying it accurately.
.ds
.indent 0
.adjust

The alteration of turns at moving first, the disparaity of our skills, and
Miriam's proclivity for a negotiated settlement all joined to favor turning 
the tables as a technique of instruction.  Her strong distaste for permitting
others to copy her ideas and her desire really to outwit me instead of accepting 
my tolerance of her copying both weighed against the method.  Despite her not
turning the tables of her own initiative and despite initial reluctance, during
this apprenticeship Miriam came to accept the method and use it effectively.

0Miriam failed to establish an attempted three corner fork in game 3.1 because
she pursued that objective instead of blocking the threat "b-a-/".  After her
refusing to turn the tables in my first attempt to have her do so (game 3.2), I emphasized
verbally the role of forced moves in play, thus: (game 3.3)

Bob:    Yes. You are forced to move there.  Now you have one way to win there
     (B-C-/).  I am forced to move here (moves c, blocking B-C threat).
Miriam: (tooting noises).
Bob:    Do I have one way to win ?  Yes.  You are forced to move down there.
Miriam: (Moves D, thereby blocking c-b-/).
Bob:    You have one way to win there (B-D-/). I am forced to move there (moves
     d, blocking B-D).
Miriam: X ! (moves E, blocking d-b-/).
Bob:     So that's a tie.

With this external verbal support, Miriam submitted her three corner fork
objective to the tactic of making forced moves.  With game 3.4, I sermonized,
"When your plans are frustrated, you shouldn't complain; you should adopt
the best expedient you can."  As I suffered her blocking my ways to win,
I reflected aloud on her frustrating my plans.  This "loud thinking" style
carried over into the next game (3.5), in which I explicitly considered her
expected responses to moves I was weighing and then based my plan on those
expectations.  (Miriam made forced moves C and D of game 3.5 without specific
direction to do so.)2

     beat you.  You're starting with an X.  I'm going to go right where
     you went.  Let's see if you can beat me just the same way I beat you.
Miriam: Wish.
Bob:    Is that the same way ?
Miriam: Did you go here ?
Bob:    Yes.  So you're going in the corner now.  (Miriam moves B). Now,
     this (b) is a forced move, because you have one way to win, so I
     have to go here.
Miriam: (Placing C) Two ways to win !

From Miriam's penultimate comment ("Two ways to win") it is clear she
recognized the fork when she achieved it through table turning.  It is not 
so obvious that she had the fork in mind as one capable of being a strategic
objective (which is surely true of the three corner fork).  The issue is
highlighted by the next game.

          Because Miriam had followed my direction in game 3.7, I offered
her the chance to retain the privledge of the first move:

Bob:    Would you like to go first again, Miriam ?
Miriam: Yeah.
Bob:    Let's see if you can beat me a different way.  I will go there again
     (moving a), but see if you can beat me some different way.
Miriam: (Moves B).
Bob:    Oh.  I have a forced move now.  I have to go there (move b).
Miriam: (Moves C, achieving a fork).
Bob:    I have a forced move, so I must go there (moves c).
Miriam: (Starts to block the 3-2-/ row ).
Bob:     No, no.
Miriam: But I blocked you.
Bob:    But is it better to block me or to win ?
Miriam: Win.  Win.
Bob:    But one of the things you have to figure, Miriam, every time you 
     have to ask yourself: "Does the other guy have a way to win ? Can I
     beat him first ?"  If you can beat him first, you don't have to stop
     him from winning, 'cause you won already.
Miriam: Right.
.ds

Could it be that Miriam intended to achieve this fork yet failed to recognize it ?
It's hard to imagine such a conclusion could be true.  In this particular game
and set of games, my emphasis on making forced moves might have biased Miriam
to look only for those and react by immediately blocking the threat.  Because she
preferred blocking to wining directly in this game, I codified for Miriam a set
of ordered rules for playing Tic tac toe:
.ss
.indent 1
.nofill
Bob:    The number one thing you look for (writing a list), you say "Can I win ?"
Miriam: Can we stop for a while ?
Bob:    Yeah.  The second thing is: forced moves.  And the third thing is what ?...
     Two ways to win.
Miriam: O.K.  What 's the seventeenth thing ?
.ds
.adjust
.indent 0

She was NOT able to take the advice of controlling play as a list of ordered rules.
Even two years later, Miriam remained strongly inclined to make a forced
move instead of winning.  Yet we have seen in this game session that she was able
to accept the advice to subordinate her strategic objective of a three corner fork
the tactical requirement of making  forced moves.  What of the differences between these two cases could explain
the surprising difference in effect. We need some way of representing the change is interaction between the CORNERS-world and those of the tactical cluster.  It's time to characterize the advice given
and to ask "Did Miriam own any sort of structure which was capable of taking that
advice ? "
.page
.ce
FIGURE 3-1
.page


     The first kind of advice was about dealing with the frustration of her strategy.
It had an obvious social cast: "Don't complain or negotiate; do the best you can." 
But more than that, it had structural implications: "Don't consider committment to
the CORNERS-world irreversible; if your strategy fails, continue play with the
tactical  cluster."  The difficulty with this first interpretation is that although
Miriam could subordinate her strategy to blocking a threat, in a strategy-failure
condition, the WIN-world never succeeded, only BLOCK functioned.  This argues that
only the BLOCK-world came into competition with the CORNERS-world.  Thus the
reorganization the advice effected was implemented not at the TURNS level but by
the restructuring of microworld interconnections as in Figure 3-1. (The two access
paths to BLOCK-world imply that it competes both with the worlds of the stepwise cluster
and CORNERS.) This ad hoc proposal gives us an effect of regulated competition.  I am not happy with it and can't prove it is the best representation, but I can contrast it with an alternative interpretation.
.page
.ce
FIGURE 3-2
.page
      Would not some path of connection between the CORNERS and WIN-worlds have
been established ?  One argument against that the BLOCK-world knowledge was a truly functional addition to the strategic cluster, but there was no functional niche
for the WIN-world to fill.  Winning after a fork is a much simpler consequence,
and different in kind, from the pattern scanning which could be expected in the
WIN-world.  But if one persists in asking, "Would not learning a simple list
of rules be so much easier than reorganizing the structure of mind ?", one must
answer in turn "Where could such a list of rules go ?"  One might imagine a rule-like
list of move-values in the POSITION-world (in contrast with the preference grid of my representation),  but the rule list of my advice (Win
first, make forced moves second and enhance position when possible) is different in
kind; it is equivalent to advising the reorganization of mind.  This latter alternative
to the organization of Figure 3-1 is diagrammed in Figure 3-2.  The difference in
structural change would be great and might require the introduction of a new frame
with a fundamentally serial charcter to work at all.  Further, such a change would
ignore the existence of the CORNERS-world which became increasingly a nuclear
entity in the developing structure of the strategic worlds.

     Note, finally in Figure 3-3, also the change effected by table turning.
This was a socially acceptable method of alternating winning which I had
criticised when the goal was attempted by negotiation.  Finally,the introduction
of table turning must have introduced in Miriam's mind a different view of me
as an opponent from that of Robby (Such is indicated in a vague manner by the box
labelled "Daddy" in Figure 3-3.

0     Game 4.1 forced Miriam into completing a fork (which she recognized).  
The dialogue recorded with game 4.2 is most revealing of the relative place of
pattern and serial features in her play.  This excerpt suggests that pattern
is ALL she considers:
.ss
.indent 1
Miriam asked if I were going to try my 'good old trick' (a corner opening); instead,
I took the middle cell.  She replied "Not usually." to my question of whether she
ever moved in those side places (as I had just been defeated doing).  When I asked,
"How come ?" she said she didn't know then confided to me her plan of going on both
sides of my center move, and also in a third corner, thereby getting two ways to win.
Such is a terribly unrealistic plan as it does not recognize the importance of being one
move ahead of the opponent nor makes allowances for the opponent's possible moves
to block such a plan. I made move b, telling Miriam I would not let her complete
such a plan.  She replied, "Then I won't do it; I'm thinking of something else."
She made her forced moves.
.ds
.indent 0

Games 4.3 and 4.5 show Miriam as willing to abandon a three corner fork objective
to make a forced move.  In 4.4, her attempt to block a three corner fork failed
when I stumbled into an unplanned expert win.  Game 4.8 witnesses Miriam not
subordinating forced moves to a chance for immediate victory.  She was forced
into establishing a fork which she did not notice and proceeded to block a threat
instead of winning.  Game 4.9 provides another example of my forcing Miriam into
making a fork she did not own as her objective.2

0In game 5.3, Miriam achieved a fork without realizing it.  I proceeded in the 
next game to replay 5.3 with the tables turned.  My indirect suggestion that
Miriam should move into the middle opening pitfall (which she did not recognize
as such) created that opportunity.  After her first move as opponent, I asked
if she knew I could win the game.  She did not believe me.  I proceeded to 
demonstrate that the M2 game pitfall leads to a fork.  The counters of the fork
form a middle plus two corners triangle.  Miriam wanted to stop but played one
more game.  Contrast now 5.4 and 5.5.  One might infer that this is a spontaneous
but imperfect attempt at table turning.  The counter patern (A-B-C of 5.4) is
triangular (as is the a-b-c of game 5.3), but the triangle of 5.5 is rotated
90 degrees from that of 5.4.  A second contra-indication is this: Miriam typically
preferred a corner to a side move; where she was not forced to move to a particular
cell, she could have simply chosen to move in the last free corner.  Of convincing
support for the table turning speculation explanation, however, is that Miriam
consistently made forced moves except where some compelling objective intervened.
I concluded this is a failing attempt to establish a fork like those of the two
preceding games.  The attempt fails for two reasons: the forking pattern does
not accomodate a second "hole" (at a or b); and the opponent, having a way to win,
escapes the fork's dilemma.
     How should knowledge of the table turning process be represented ?  Let us address
this issue now.  The idea of table turning was easy for Miriam to assimilate for at 
least two reasons.  First, it was a socially approved method for alternate winning which
could displace the criticised method of public negotiation.  Secondly, the procedure
was based on copying. Copying was of minimal confusion because our markers were
usually written in different colors of ink and the sequence of markers was always
preserved (I used either letters or numbers as markers).  If it be unclear that Miriam
could execute table turning successfully, her ability to do so is amply demonstrated
in the following sections.  In Figure 5-1, we represent the procedure of table turning
as an additional mode of play possible from the control node in TURNS which selects between
play of the tactical and strategic clusters.  Thus we distinguish between knowledge
OF table turning (i.e. how to do it) from knowledge ABOUT table turning(i.e. what
it's for, alternate winning.

SYNOPSIS0
.twinch 5
.ss
FORCED MOVES -- Miriam showed no appreciation of the offensive use 
of forced moves.
GAMES KNOWLEDGE -- Miriam was introduced to the expert wins of corner
opening games C1-C4.  The first three she executed in table-turning sequence.
Opening C4 is represented by a single game.  At 9.2 Miriam exhibited her
command of opening C1 as initiator (encountered in the earlier games 7.5,
7.6, 8.7).  Her use of the opening C3 expert win is less certain (9.1).
(She had encountered the expert win in games 7.2-7.4 and 8.1).  Miriam's
learning of openings C2 and C4 is not revealed (but see games l0.3 and 
l0.4 in the next section).  In 9.3, given a hint, Miriam was able to predict
the specific move by which I would block her victory in form C5.
REPRESENTATION -- Miriam's comments at game 7.7 separate as identifiable
elements the opening, response, the crux and "this good trick", which 
I take to refer to either the fork or to the link establishing it.  She
did not mention her antagonist's move between the crux and fork, on the
basis of which fact I speculate she had not yet realized the role of the
crux as excluding the the antagoinist's interference with placement of
the link.  That is, she did not see the necessary connection between the
game opening and fork; there was no logically necessary bridge and thus
no explicitly understood game-length strategy.  Miriam showed herself
capable of "chances-to-win" analysis; in 7.7 she identified two chances
to win and, despite my explicit statement that her next move should be
where those two chances intersect, moved elsewhere.  A more forceful
intervention inspired her to review and apply her analysis.  I infer
that she owned such procedures but they did not dominate her behavior
without external support.  Finally, her description of victory in 8.1
implies she thought of that win as a confluence of a forced move she
needed to make and the achievement of a fork (cf. also game 6.1).
This is an adequate description of the specific game but one inadequate
(in not recognizing the role of the crux) and insufficiently general
for describing other expert wins.
RIGIDITY -- The same game, 8.7, exemplifies the interplay of
flexibility and rigidity.  Not remembering an expert win for opening C1,
Miriam applied the crux and link appropriate to opening C2 which she had
just encountered in a series of table turnings (games 8.3-8.5) Thus she
showed flexibility in using analogy for guidance but rigidity in its
application; her opening C2 effective procedure dominated the
"chances-to-win" analysis which should determine placement of the link.
LEARNING FROM AN OPPONENT'S PLAY --  The observations of
these sessions show that Miriam was able to take instruction
in table turning mode with considerable effect over the intermediate
term.  But turning the tables is a technique for first transforming
on opponent's play into your own and learning from your own execution.
Had Miriam learned to do that ? Had she learned a technique for learning ?
Because these four sessions were directed by my instruction, the question
can not be answered from these observations.  The answer appears in
the next section, "On Her Own".

0Two different tactics complemented table turning during this session by focussing
on the relationship of the two players.  Games 6.4 and 6.5 addressed explicitly 
the value of thinking about the antagonist's possible moves.  Games 6.3 and 6.6 raise 
the issue of the opponent's play by my taking direction from Miriam on where to move.
(As expected, I got tricked, but these games put Miriam in charge of play by both
initiator and opponent in such a way that it became public when she was not playing
fair.)  Thus (of game 6.6):
.ss

    (moves c).
Miriam: (Moves C; makes noises of discontent when I gesture to cell 4).
Bob:    You tell me where to move.
Miriam: Here (cell 7).

     As she capitalized on my taking the pitfall of opening M2 in game 6.1, Miriam
claimed to have wanted beforehand to place the link C where she was forced to 
("I had a forced move, and I wanted to move there.")  In the next game, Miriam
fortuitously also made the M2 pitfall.  This provided me the opportunity of turning
the tables on her (which had not thus far been done) and thinking out loud at every
step of a determined game which I controlled.

with corning opening C5, she believed and asserted she already knew it.  She did know --

opponent fell into the trap.  My objective was to split off four variants of play
from the good trick she knew (games C1 through C4).  My ultimate objective was for
Miriam to exhaust the possible variations of corner play and be aware that she had
done so.  I am certin that these ambitious objectives were not completely achieved.2

0Games 7.2 - 7.3 exhibit the basic process of instruction through table turning.
Following my win of 7.2, Miriam took my advice to use the same clever trick
(at move B after response a in 7.3).  During her role switch in applying this
advice, Miriam switched from using X as her marker to literally copying the
numbers I had used in game 7.2. ( Game 7.4 duplicated at my request the table
turning of 7.3 in a symmetrical variation.)  A second sequence of table turning
appears in games 7.5 and 7.6.  In this set, I proposed to show Miriam expert
play for opening C1.  When I claimed that I would probably beat her, Miriam 
tried to frustrate my plan by playing the counter-move which caused her such
confusion in her earliest attempts to achieve a three corner fork.  Miriam
successfully turned the tables.  The symbols she used in the actual game
show her slipping over into direct copying of my previous  moves.

     When I asked her to play the symmetric variant of game 7.6 (as 7.4 is the
symmetric variant of 7.3), she refused and required my going first, since it
was my turn.  We played one game of form C2 before the end of the session. 
After my defeating her, Miriam confided to me that she would try to use this
gambit on her brother when next they played.

This little episode serves to raise the issue of how to represent two distinct
(but interacting) kinds of knowledge: first is knowledge of how to proceed, what
to do next; second is knowledge about the efficacy of one's functional knowledge.
We will address this issue at the end of this session. By the conclusion, this question of prediction will be seen to be a major factor in the development of Miriam's play.
     What I imagine will be typical of more general use of table turning occurs
in the sequence of gmaes 8.3 through 8.5.  The first of these is a lost opportunity.
Through her ignorance of a good  move at the crux,  a potential C2 expert win
degenerated to a tie.  When she failed of the expert win after my move a in 8.3, 
I informed Miriam of her oversight. (She had suffered an expert defeat at my
hands in game 7.7).  She was angry and had to be cajoled to re-play game 8.3 with
roles reversed.  When she moved A in game 8.4, I reviewed her move of game 8.3
(B) comparable to the one I then made (b).

Bob:     You went down here, where the B is, next to this a.  If you had
        gone over here, where my b is now --
Miriam: Yeah ?
Bob:    You could have beat me.... You know why ?
Miriam: Why ?
Bob:    'Cause now you've got a forced move between the a and b.
Miriam: Oh (Moves B).
Bob:    Now, what chances to win do I have ?  From the b across the bottom;
    from the a across the top; from the a down through the middle;
    from the b up through the middle.  And I have to go in the middle
    because you have one way to win.  Now look at this --
Miriam: I get it.
Bob:    I take my forced move --
Miriam: (A little angry with me) I get it.
Bob:    Two ways to win.

Miriam became angry on suffering this defeat.  She even cried a little and wanted
to quit, and generally did her best to make me feel like a bad guy.  When she was
convinced to turn the tables on me, she played game 8.5 and beat me directly.
With the compensatory victory achieved, she no longer wanted to quit.
     The recorded dialogue attendent on game 8.7 is quite valuable in illuminating
Miriam's grasp of the experiences she had.  (This game of form C1 was last encountered
in the table turning of 7.5 and 7.6.)  After my move a, I asked:

Bob:    Do you remember how to beat me ?
Miriam: Unh-uh.  (Then she laughed and moved B).
Bob:    Oh, you've got me now.
Miriam: (Gestures to make a middle move).
Bob:    (Stopping her) Show me your chances to win.
Miriam: (Gestures along the top and from B up through the middle cell).
Bob    If you want two ways to win, you have to move where the chances to win 
        come together.
Miriam: (Gestures to move in the middle).
Bob:    That's wrong.
Miriam: It is ?
Bob:    Where do your two chances comes together ?
Miriam: Here (along the top), here ((up through the middle).  Here (the
        intersection corner).  If I go here, you can block here (the
        middle cell), but I'll go here (cell 2).
Bob:    O.K.

Miriam made move C and linked her two ways to win.
     My interpretation of the sequence is this.  Upon my response to her opening,
Miriam realized she did not remember how to achieve an expert win.  Then,
considering how similar appear the openings of C2 and C1, she adopted the crux
of game C2 for stepwise guidance.  My argument that she now "had me" confirmed
this choice and led her to continue using the procedure just developed for opening
C2 in games 8.3 through 8.5.  The analysis of chances to win I asked of her was
made but dinstinctly not applied to game 8.7 which she proposed to complete with
the link of game 8.5  My stopping that procedure and pointing to the necessary
analysis led her to substitute its conclusion for the next step of the imperfectly
applied procedure.

     Miriam's play in game 8.1 and 8.7 requires us to admit that after table
turning she owns knowledge of other strategic games beside the three corner fork.
In 8.1, Miriam defeated me by an expert win (introduced vbia table turning in
7.2 and 7.4).  I have just argued the influence of games 8.3 - 8.5 on game 8.7.2

0We classify these games as forms C2 and C3.  Did Miriam see them as different from or as variations upon her three corner fork ?  In both these games, her first three moves occupy three corners.  In game 8.1, her moves do not differ at all from her moves in a typical C5 game (the prototype for her corner opening play).  In game 8.5, the diagonal corners are placed after the in-between corner.  Does this imply that Miriam owned some significant new knowledge ?  I think the answer is "yes", but the question is "What is it ?" and "How shall we represent it ?".

     If we represent the basic knowledge of the CORNERS world by a preference grid, we should recognize three (at least) kinds of changes as significant.  The simplest kinds is extension of application.  Recall that originally Miriam was only able to continue with her three corner fork objective when the C5 opening win developed.  Thus her ability to apply those preferences to a C3 game represents learning through a relaxation of rigidity.  A second kind of significant knowledge is best exemplified by the two well-known outcomes of the C5 opening.  I see such knowledge as a fixing and further specification of a game's progress, without any enhanced understanding.  Such well known results show an ad hoc or fragmentary comprehension of the game.  We represent these aspects of knowledge in Figure 8-1 as dependent from the CORNERS world and by their associated opening game classifications.  Thus there are two C5 outcomes (win or tie, depending on the opponent) and the C3 game is a relaxed kind of C5 game.  Play of the C2 game is different in kind from the C5 game and can be represented as a different result of CORNERS world play (if we are generousa enough to admit that Miriam knows how to play that specific game).  Similarly, if Miriam owned ad hoc knowledge of the M2 outcome at this time, it would be represented as dependent from the POSITION world.
     The third kind of knowledge change we should recognize as significant is value changes withinthe preference grid.  I don't claim to explain such changes, but let us  note them where appropriate.  From the initial, incomplete grid of her early play, the more flexible behavior of later play should be reflected in the preference grid of Figure 8 - 1.
     Finally, Miriam's knowledge was not limited in kind to functional knowledge.  For
example, we represent Miriam's committment to try the expert ploy of game C2
against Robby at their next playing as applying to" Robby.  As cited dialogue
witnesses, Miriam  also owned knowledge ABOUT the efficacy of her strategies.  We
conclude there is not only the knowledge OF games as represented by the functional
microworlds but also knowledge ABOUT games which we represent schematically in "Games".  (The "may" in parentheses indicates Miriam's uncertainty; the
unparenthetical "may" of game C5 indicates that this ploy permits traps but no
expert victory.)

GAMES 9.1 - 9.4 (@6;--;--)

ARGUMENT
The intention of session 9 was to explore all the games Miriam could see as
different responses to the corner opening.  This required the setting aside
of table turning for a series of games in all of which she was the initiator.
Two questions can be asked of these data.  First, which games has Miriam mastered.
Second, has Miriam learned a method of learning Tic tac toe. The latter question
will be addressed in a subsequent section. An answer to the first would let us
infer in a gross way how useful these few table turning experiences have been in
creating memorable effective procedures.2

0Game 9.1 shows for opening C3 Miriam would move correctly at the crux and from
that point would probably continue to achieve an expert win.  Miriam's delayed 
realization of her upcoming victory indicates she did not yet see that game as
a whole.

    you can beat me ?
Miriam: (Moves B). I don't know.

Miriam: Unh-uh.
Bob:    No ?  Do I have a forced move ?
Miriam: Yeah.... Actually, I have [beat you].  You have a forced move.
Bob:    Then what ?
Miriam: I'll move there (cell 3) and get two ways to win.
Bob:    So you've beat me already.

Contrast Miriam's certainty in this segment of dialogue (9.2, game form C1) with that of the
preceding game:

Bob:    Let's suppose I move here (cell 9). Will you beat me ?
Miriam: I don't know. (Is she being evasive ?)
Bob:    I'll try it.
Miriam: (Laughs) I'll put my B here ! (cell 7).
Bob:    Ohoh.  Do you have me beat already ?
Miriam: Yep.  See.  I go there (cell 3) and I've got two ways tow in (Gleeful
     laughter).
Bob:    So as soon as I put my a in there, you knew you could beat me.
Miriam: Uh-huh.

This dialogue testifies that a well-known result representing a C1 form game, should be
added to the strategic cluster of Figure 8-1.  It is true, as Miriam claims, that
after move C she has two ways to win.  But does that mean to her what it means to us?
We see the pattern as a V-shaped fork. It shares the pattern and sequence of her C2 victory.  At   Does Miriam still see it as a three-corner
fork ?  At this point, I would judge so, and append a C1 known result to that of C2 (as is done in Figure 9-1. Is Miriam sensistive to the role of "holes" in the structure of forks ?
These data stand mute.  However, the dialogue of game 8.7 argues that if Miriam's
play rises to the level of explicit analysis, she thinks about ways to win and
blocking them; if she proceeds without analysis, her directions may be misguided
by focussing on the counters in a pattern without attending to holes. These contrasting behaviors argue that Miriam does own analytically applicable strategic knowledge, but that this knowledge is not integrated with the control over play she exercises.  Therefore, in Figure 9-1 we represent <iriam's analytical capabilities as knowledge ABOUT play in the TURNS frame.  This separation of knowledge ABOUT play from knowledge OF play does NOT imply it is without effect.  For example,  her first enthusiasm for game C5 and hope for victory in game 9.3 subsided when she predicted that I would avoid the traps. Thus the knowledge of the TURNS frame has effect as a reflection upon the current state and prospects of play, even though not yet integrated into control structure of execution.  Game 9.4 introduced Miriam to opening C4 in the context of seeking expert wins and does not speak to the issue of how effective is table turning as an instructional method.
     The general conclusion we can draw from this analysis is that table turning has helped to fix, at least temporarily, specific game results in Miriam's mind.  We speculate that Miriam saw these various games as different ways of achieving her earlier, once more specific three corner objective.
