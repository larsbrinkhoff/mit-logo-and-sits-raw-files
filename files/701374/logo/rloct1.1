We raise the issue of how social experience interacts with the personal construction of mind.  The articulation of complementary roles is a pattern of human learning which can be seen in  behavior over a range of apparent sophistication that extends from an infant's acquiring specific protocols of speech to an author's consideration of readers' reactions to his writing.  Here  a lucid example of the process is uncovered by tracing in detail one child's learning of Tic tac toe over several years.  The corpus of observations assembled during this period is rich in development and reasonably complete in covering the child's overt behavior.

1INTRODUCTION0
.ds

     Tic Tac Toe is a ubiquitous game of the American child's culture.  It is a significant game because its mastery requires integration of two different points of view, those of the first player and his opponent.  The need for the articulation of multiple roles is required in other mental activities of a range which extends from the infant's learning of specific speech protocols to the composition of effective written communication.  That is, such composition demands the author consider the view points of his audience.  Should we not seek the germs or precursors of such mature mental performance as effective writing in children's activities which impose the same demand - such as  playing simple strategic games ?
     This case study probes into the mystery of learning by the extensive presentation and detailed analysis of how one child learned to play Tic tac toe.  Fundamantal arguments justifying such an effort are found in the classical literature of Psychology [1]. Setting aside such arguments, let us begin this endeavor with an important question: Is this work ABOUT TIC TAC TOE or is  it ABOUT LEARNING ?  My stance derives from this slogan of Papert's: "You can't think about thinking; you can only think about thinking about something." [2]. My minor variation of this powerful idea is "You can't learn about learning; you can only learn about learning something."  THIS work is ABOUT LEARNING, but to probe that mystery we focus on how one child learned about Tic tac toe.  The strategy of the paper is first to discuss representations of the game and the mind, then to present and interpret observations of behavior and, finally, to describe the interaction of social experience and the personal construction of mind.
     Significant learning did occur during this case study. The six year old subject, Miriam, initially knew so little of Tic Tac Toe that she couldn't continue playing when confronted by an unanticipated response to her opening move in a game.  Six months later, Miriam was  playing both sides of the game, making "smart" moves for both players.  Two years later, she was able to prove predictions of victories by detailing the offensive use of forced moves in games worked out in her mind.
     One aspect of the observations is surprising: they are complete.  The materials are a thematic extract from THE INTIMATE STUDY,   a six months long naturalistic study of Miriam's mental development.  The completeness was achieved because Miriam is my daughter.  For the six months of The Intimate Study, we were constant companions, and Miriam was under constant observation.  Occasional observations from the following two years are cited  to capture her accession to the idea of opening advantage, her invention of a new strategic objective, and a "final" level of performance. All her publicly manifest behavior relevant to Tic Tac Toe is captured in the corpus and presented here.

Rules and Representation -0

     Webster's Third International Dictionary describes Tic Tac Toe  ( also called "noughts and crosses".) as, "...a game in which two players alternately put crosses and ciphers in compartments of a figure formed by two vertical lines crossing two horizontal lines and try to get a row of three crosses or three ciphers before the opponent does...."   This abstract description of Tic Tac Toe, though accurate, leaves out most everything of interest, the stratagems and ploys which are its heart.  Further, the implicit representation of the game does not preserve the process of its play.  The record of this game

stands mute on the steps by which one player vanquished his opponent.
The technique I employ to preserve a record of sequence in the data 
is to have the first player (let me call him the "initiator") and
opponent each use ordered series of tokens for markers in place of
the more usual noughts and crosses.   Such a
representation offers no means of indicating which player initiated
the game and had the opening advantage.  The means I've selected
to impose such information coherently on the basic representation
is to note the first move (upper or lower case "a") above the grid.
The example above, when so recorded,

     We will frequently have need to refer to specific cells within the grid or framework within which the game is played.  Let us keep in the backs of our minds an implicit representation wherein the individual cells are numbered in sequence from left to right and from top to bottom, thus:2

0An Everyday View -
.ds
     Tic Tac Toe is a simple game, child's play -- what children do
in school when bored by their lessons.  Most adults in America are
CASUAL PLAYERS of the game: they indulged in the pasttime themselves
as children and, as adults, play occasionally with children.  
For example, I have seen adults in restaurants so entertain children
while they await their dinner.  As such a casual player myself,
I noted two games as of special interest:2

The first game shows the initiator defeating an opponent who fell into
the PITFALL of move a.  The second game shows the initiator setting TRAPS
(marked by dashes): if a second player moves in any such cell, his defeat
by an expert is certain.  Thus, a "skilled" initiator, one with these bits
of knowledge, would frequently defeat a naive opponent, one who could
not avoid the pitfall of move "a" or the traps of the second game.
The skilled defensive player following very simple rules ( avoiding
pitfalls he knew as initiator and making all forced moves ) would
assure himself a tie.  So seen, the game lacks interest.  One can only
defeat an opponent who makes a naive or careless error.  There is
little premium for knowledge or cleverness.  There appears to be
little or nothing about the game which is worthwhile.

     Miriam's play during the first five sets of games convinced me
a richer view of Tic Tac Toe was needed to make any sense at all of
her proclivities and to provide guidance that she could incorporate
into her own knowledge.  The observations in the next section, 
AT THE BEGINING, clearly establish the importance of patterns
of her counters in Miriam's representation of and thought about
the game.  The attempt to formulate a pattern-oriented view 
of Tic Tac Toe was a response to the initial observations.

An Opening Oriented View -
     Attempting to gauge the size of the task in developing  
a pattern-oriented view of Tic Tac Toe, a little exposure to
mathematics inclines one to think in terms of permutations.
The different arrangements of nine things taken nine at a time is too big
a number to worry about.  Considering symmetry provides simplifications.
Invariance under rotation being granted, there can be only three 
initial moves: middle, corner, and side.  To each of these opening moves,
only a few responses are possible: to a middle opening, two ( a side cell
or a corner); to a corner cell, five; to a side cell, five.  The number
of games necessary to consider is twelve.  However, as many as seven
moves remain and remembering games with all those endings is a
computational explosion for  the human mind (at least for one such 
as mine is).  ONE SURPRISING FACT makes it possible to imagine 
a simple but systematic view of Tic Tac Toe: of the twelve opening games
defined by the placement of the first two markers, seven openings
permit a direct victory by an expert initiator.  These twelve openings,
with expert wins represented, are set out in Figure I.  Four of the
twelve openings are rarely encountered, i.e. since the common response
to a side opening is a middle counter-move, games S1, S2, S3, and S5
are hardly ever played.  Of the five corner openings, four permit
an expert win and the fifth permits setting of traps.  There is
only one safe defense against a corner opening ( a middle response
with the opponent's subsquent move in a side cell):2

If you grant the casual player's view is focussed on middle openings,
the conclusion is inescapable that an enormous advantage accrues
to an initiator who opens in the corner.

     What knowledge must one own to exhibit generally superior play ?
.nofill
.ss
For offensive play:
     1. expert wins at games M2, C1, C2, C3, C4.
     2. setting traps in games M1 and C5.
For defensive play:
     l. never respond with a mid-row move to a middle opening.
     2. always respond with a middle move to a side opening.
     3. avoid the traps of game M1.
     4. the defense for game C5.

"-" means a move in this cell by the opponent implies his defeat.
"*" means this is a cell where the initiator may win after his opponent's
    next turn; two such imply a fork exists.

0A Fork Oriented View -
     An alternative view, both orthogonal to and complementary to the
opening oriented view, can be seen as necessary from this observation:
Miriam's play, definitely pattern-oriented, focussed more on patterns
to be achieved - forks, in fact - than on opening patterns which permit
a chain of forced moves to her victory.

     A "WAY TO WIN" is any row of three cells with two like markers in it
(both either upper case or lower ), the third cell being empty.  A FORK
is a marker-connected intersection of two such ways to win.  The strategic
power derives from making that intersection by the emplacement of a "LINK"
at the intersection of two rows which had been merely "CHANCES TO WIN".
(Such is a row of three cells, two empty.)  Placing the link creates two
ways to win with one move.  The opponent can only block one, and thus the
forking player is assured of victory.  As with opening moves, links may be
in the middle, corner or side cells.  This divides forks into three classes.
Within those classes, the forms of intersection are four: T, L, V, and X
(both right and skewed).  Forks are distinguished not only by the patterns of counters in place but also by the empty cells ("holes", represented by asterisks) which define both the two places where a win might be achieved.  

 The specification of forks as patterns both of markers and holes
delimits precisely the opponent's moves which frustrate a fork.  In turn,
this emphasizes the role of the move following the opening and its response
s crucial: it must appear as a marker in the fork; it must force the opponent's
next move to a non-interfering cell; finally, it must prohibit the opponent's
next move from impeding the placement of the link.  For example, the second
of the two games below fails because this crucial move (call it the "crux")
accidentally inhibits linkage of two chances to win by permitting the
opponent to establish his  way to win which must be blocked:

The objective, being to place the link at L is frustrated because move C
must now block the row a-b-/.  Lest one think misplacement of the crux
may merely lose a potential victory, contrast the expert win and the defeat
below following a faux pas after opening C1:2

             C1                C1

0Complementarity of Opening and Fork Oriented Views -
     The opening oriented view gains power from a surprising fact (the extent
to which expert wins permit simplifying one's thinking about Tic Tac Toe) and
is useful because it gives effective guidance.  For example, when an opponent
responds to a corner opening by an opposite corner move, a crux marker placed
in either free corner guarantees the initiator's victory.  Such a formulation
is of a sort useful in play.  In contrast, the fork-oriented view goes a long way
to explaining the "surprising fact" that renders its complement effective.  
That view focusses on analysis of what is possible after an opening.  Thinking
in its terms may be too cumbersome for everyday play, but it may be well suited
for a person puzzling over past games or playing them against himself.

     The essential complementarity is that both point to the crux, the initiator's
move after the opponent's response to the opening, as the critical bridge between
opening and fork.  Its functions are illuminated from a fork-oriented perspective.
When an appropriate crux follows an opening move as a well-known result, the
analysis necessary to establish a fork is simple: "look for that place where
your chances to win intersect; move there."

1A VIEW OF MIND0
     The question of how to best represent mind is one of contention in cognitive studies.  I will not argue for my chosen representation here but will simply apply ideas current in my research community to describe, as perspicuously as I am able, structures which may produce in performance the empirical corpus of observations to which my work is committed.  Details of the view will be exemplified and extended during the body of the paper.
     We begin with the stance that the substance of mind is descriptions, some of which have been promoted to the status of concepts by processes of emphasis. [3]  Going beyond the descriptions of Winston, the structures I employ (I call them microworlds) [4], are active and competitively organized.  They do not merely recognize some situation, they act upon it.  The typical situation contemplated is one of solving some simple problem, e.g. 2 + ? = 4.  One part of a microworld, the PERSPECTIVE, parses the problem into its elements.  The successful parsing activates the FUNCTIONS (the second major microworld component) which generate the solution to the problem.  A similar, simple problem presented to a Tic tac toe microworld might be "What move next ?", given information about the state of the game.  The function of such a microworld could select the highest-valued empty cell in the input grid by referencing an experience-established PREFERENCE GRID of cell values, thus:

               -----------
                5 | 1 | 5 

.ds
.adjust
In the course of the following interpretations, we will ask and try to answer such questions as: "what microworlds should we ascribe to Miriam ?"; "How are the microworlds organized ?"; and "How do the microworlds change ?"
     Our attempt to describe the structures of mind based on the observations of this study lead us to consider larger scale knowledge structures  reflecting aspects of the social context in which the game takes place.  These larger scale structures, which I take to be frame-like [5], are assigned the function of controlling turn-taking, influencing the committment to objectives, and answering predictive questions, such as "Have you won this game already ?"  Based on her answers to such predictive questions, we will conclude that Miriam's knowledge of necessary relations between pattern and serial aspects of the game progressed from the first to the third of the four stages described below:
.ss
.nofill
.indent 2
1. MINIMAL COMPREHENSION - witnessed by vague hopes of victory.
2. FRAGMENTARY COMPREHENSION - based on well-known outcomes of
    specific games.
3. PROCEDURAL COMPREHENSION - exhibited by the stepwise working
    out and proof of predicted victories.
4. SYSTEMATIC COMPREHENSION - such as is seen in the classification
    of openings and the analysis of how the crux relates openings 
    and forks.
