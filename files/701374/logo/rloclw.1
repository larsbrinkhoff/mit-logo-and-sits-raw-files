     This is a case study of how one child learned to write in a computer-rich
setting.  Although computer access did affect significantly her learning, the detail
presented here go beyond supporting that claim.  They provide a simple example of
what a computer-based introduction to writing might be like for other children.  We
conclude with a short discussion of issues raised by the study.

1INTRODUCTION0

     At the end of a long study of the computer's impact on their learning,
I asked my children if they thought of their experience at the Logo computer lab
as being the same as or different from school.  Robby (then 8) answered first:

Bob:     How are they different ?  
Robby:   You don't learn anything at Logo.
Bob:     Oh ?... And you do at school ?  
Robby:   Yes.
Bob:     What do you learn ?...  I know you have art, for example, but you
         knew how to draw before you went to school.
Robby:   You learn... ah... mathetating.
Bob:     Mathetating ?
Robby:   Mathetating: what you do with numbers.
Bob:     Don't you ever do adding at Logo ?
Robby:   Yeah, but all you ever learn at Logo is how to use computers.
Miriam:  I learned how to write.

Miriam clearly believed that she learned to write using computers during the period
of our study.  I believe it too, in a very strong sense: the particular writing which
Miriam produced served her later as prototypical of what compositions should be like.
For example, years later when taking an entrance examination which required the
writing of a composition, Miriam reproduced and extended the same story she wrote at
the end of our Logo study.  To place the detail of this article in a comprehensible
context, let me present summary descriptions of the Logo Project and The Intimate
Study.


     Logo at M.I.T. began as the Education Research project of the Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory.  More recently it has also been affiliated organizationally with
M.I.T.'s Division for Study and Research in Education.  Throughout its existence,
the project's objective has been to mould the computer presence to support natural
learning, that directed  by the child herself.  An early focus was on the creation
of a "mathland", a computer-rich setting wherein a child would absorb mathematical
knowledge almost without realizing that she was learning.[1]   (Note here that although
Robby didn't do any "mathetating" at Logo, he did execute a computer design project
of his own imagining wherein he calculated, in order, all the primes under 50 to
generate a complete set of the prime-based symmetrical INSPI designs within that
range.)  My own work in this vein is best presented in another study of Miriam,
ONE CHILD'S LEARNING.[2]   Even if one's interest were restricted to the learning
of arithmetic (which, at Logo, it never was), to study natural learning and to
shape computers to serve natural learning, one must follow a child out of "math"
worlds to others, as we do here (and have done otherwheres [3]).    Following natural
learning was my objective during in the research project wherein I assembled the
corpus I refer to as The Intimate Study.  Since the material of this article comes
from that corpus, I will describe the study now.

     The Intimate Study was a six month long study of two children, focussed
on one (Miriam, then six years old), buttressed by recall of the past and enriched
by noting later developmental outcomes.  On the basis of this study, I can characterize
Miriam as a bright child (interpretations of both a Stanford-Binet and a Piagetian
profile concur that at the age of six years she functioned as would a nine year old -
but as one with lacunae in arithmetic and verbal knowledges).  Further, she was an
agreeable child, one working WITH her father on a project as a colleague (by this
statement I imply that Miriam had much control over what we did).  In this sense,
the study was a sort of "cognitive anthropology" in the respect it granted to the
subject of the study.  The Intimate Study was cognitive anthropology in other senses
as well, in attempting to trace the child's learning beyond the confines of the lab
and in depending upon naturalistic observation as well as upon the recording of
pre-set experiments and working sessions.  The product of The Intimate Study is a
coherent corpus which can be analysed to answer such questions as, "How, precisely,
did her experiences affect this child's learning to write ?"  With respect to the
question of Miriam's introduction to writing, the corpus is reasonably complete.
In contrast, the corpus can not answer precisely, "How did her experiences affect
this child's learning to read ?"  The Intimate Study and other work [4] can, however,
illuminate the answer to this question.  I will digress now to describe how Miriam
learned to read because of the general belief that reading and writing knowledges
are closely related.  (When and how reading and writing knowledges become closely
related I consider an interesting and imperfectly settled question, but it is not 
one I address here.)

1LEARNING TO READ 
0
     Her learning to read was something, as I recall it, pretty much of Miriam's
own doing.  Of course, she was read to as a child, and we played the game "I am 
thinking of a word" at our supper table,[5] but Miriam early showed an interest in
reading as her brother was first learning to do so.  While he played with sets of cards
with common terminal digraphs (e.g. SUN, FUN, GUN), Miriam learned her letters and some
of the sounds the consonants make.  Her view of her learning to read is this:
.nofill
.indent 2
.ss
Miriam:  I learned to read from HOP ON POP.[6]
Bob:     You did ?  How did that teach you to read ?  I don't understand.
Miriam:  I started with the easy books and went to the harder ones.
.ds
.indent 0
.adjust

My recollection is a little different, that she learned to read a large numbers of words
by sight (about l00) from a set of cards I made containing all the words of PUT ME IN
THE ZOO. [7]    I recall a period of two weeks or so when Miriam gradually mastered those
words, after which she was vastly surprised to find herself capable of reading her
brother's first school book.  Upon completing that book (at age 5;6), Miriam declared
herself a reader.  About the same time, Robby's developing interest in the Second World
War impelled him into a range of material Miriam could not approach, so the reading to
them of common bedtime stories ceased and each began to pursue his interests.  Miriam
typically brought home from the library books by Syd Hoff, e.g. THUNDERHOOF and WHO
WILL BE MY FRIENDS ? When going to bed, she  would carry with her a stack of such
books or some of her mother's PEANUTS and POGO cartoon books.

     With this background, the second grade series of Dick and Jane books [8] seemed
appropriate for assessing Miriam's reading ability and proved to be so.  In the reading
examination at the start of The Intimate Study, Miriam read fluently and with good
comprehension stories from each of the three sections of the book (they are graduated
in difficulty).  Her execution of exercises from the companion THINK AND DO workbook
showed her awareness of how context selects between potentially ambiguous meanings of
words and how idiomatic meanings of phrases dominate those of included words.  Miriam's
typical word-level error was substitution of a context compatible word with similar
initial and terminal characters for words she could not recognize.  At the sentence and
paragraph level, her lack of knowledge of punctuation's functions leads her into
inappropriate divisions of running text.  An extreme example of the confusions this led
to was her ignornace of the significance of a question mark in standard text:
.ss
.indent 2
.nofill

Bob:     What does this say ? (pointing to the sentence, "Is it Billy's ?"), that
         sentence with the funny hook on the end ?
Miriam:  I dont... that means "what next".  (The question mark is the prompt character
         of the Logo language interpreter implemented on the computer system used
         during The Intimate Study.)
Bob:     It means "what next" ?  That's what a question mark means in Logo, yes, but
         that's not what it means when you read it in a book.  That's a question.  The
         sentence says, "Is it Billy's ?"
.ds
.indent 0
.adjust

I believed such limitations would have prevented Miriam from reading more difficult
material with comprehension.  The level of the challenge engaged her interest.  That
same evening at home she did exercises from the workbook (and informed me afterwards). 
Over the next several days, Miriam read us parents bedtime stories from FRIENDS OLD
AND NEW and took it to school for reading to friends in kindergarden.

     During the six months of The Intimate Study, Miriam's reading was dominated,
at her choice, by POGO and PEANUTS cartoon books.  I could not, on the basis of her
casual reading, judge what would best test her capability at age 6;6.  We discussed
the problem.  Miriam characterized FRIENDS OLD AND NEW as "easy-bezy".  "Was it so
back in April ?" I inquired.  Miriam answered that the book had been pretty hard for
her to read earlier.  We agreed that the solution to my problem was for her to select
the book for her final reading evaluation.  At an education materials supply store,
Miriam skimmed the sixth and fifth grade books and declared them too hard for her.
Examining the fourth and third grade readers, she selected MORE ROADS TO FOLLOW [9] 
(a book for the second half of third grade) as having a level of difficulty comparable
to the book used six months earlier.  Miriam's judgment was verified subsequently; 
she proved able to read her book but exhibited some difficulty.  The outstanding
problems were with syllabification and phonetic pronunciation of unfamiliar words.
(She had never been instructed in these skills.)
I conclude that Miriam's skill level advanced by three half-grades during the six
months of our research.  This is a significant advance about which I intend to make
NO claims.  Although it is reasonable to say that computer-reading shared center
stage with Pogo and Charlie Brown during the period of development, it would be rash
to claim any special impact on her reading skill, as the following incident suggests:
While passing through a room where Miriam was watching TV, I was stopped by her question,
"Daddy, what does choreography mean ?"; Miriam had been reading movie credits.  This
extreme of lexical exploration argues that Miriam was reading all the time.  In contrast
with reading, Miriam's introduction to writing fell completely within the purview of
The Intimate Study and was significant.  Let us now examine that development in
detail.

WRITING BEFORE THE INTIMATE STUDY
0
     Miriam didn't write much before she was six, in any standard sense of
composition.  There were, however, two kinds of activities she engaged in which can
be seen as the precursors of the stories and letters she wrote later.  A typical
precursor of story writing was a kindergarden activity where the teacher or one of
her helpers would ask a child to tell the story of a picture the child had drawn.
The requesting adult would then write the story on a piece of paper and attach it to
the picture.  My favorite of the genre is this:
.nofill

In the year preceding The Intimate Study, a large portion of Miriam's drawings took 
the form of "presents" she made for others.  A typical example is this: after drawing
a picture of "football Fred" from Ed Emberley's DRAWING BOOK OF FACES, Miriam prepared
it as a gift for her playmate Brian (whose entire family was committed to football).
Miriam wrote at the side "football Fred" and at the top "To Brian/Love/Miriam".  Miriam
spoke of such drawings as presents many times.  One formal elements of these notes
reflects that character.  Each typically bore a "tag" with conjoined salutation and
closing.  Her initial tags were of the form "To ________/From Miriam".  I believe
the change to the later tag form "To _______/Love/Miriam" was influenced by receiving
postcards from her great-grandmother who closed her every missive with the valediction
"Love/G.G."

WRITING STORIES
0
     The central idea of the writing experiences in The Intimate Study was to
segregate the content and structure of writing by use of a computer language interface.
The reasons for doing so were as follows.  A major problem of all writing instruction is
sensitizing the writer to the expectations of the audience.  Even mature writers face 
the difficulty of discriminating between the desire for expression and the restraint that
is often required for effective communication.  Such a problem is exacerbated when the
writer is a young child, one who may be unused to casting herself imaginatively in the
role of a possible audience for the text she is composing, one who may not even conceive
of the purpose of writing as effective communication.  The strategy embodied in the idea
of a computer language interface is to pre-establish the structure of a piece of text
and to form the content of the text from the writer's direct expression; the final end,
to be hoped for if not achieved, is that the writer in reading and re-reading her own
composition will first perceive the structure vaguely as an envelope surrounding her
content and later as a specific form into which she can cast her content for its
effective communication.


     Effective natural learning requires that material to be learned relate simply
to the learner's past, personal experiences.  In this specific case, I was
fortunate in being able to present Miriam as a generalized story structure
a specific joke-script by which she had recently victimized me:
.ss
.nofill
.indent 2
Miriam:  Would you like to hear a short story ?
Bob:     Sure.
Miriam:  Once upon a time, the end.  That's a SHORT story.
.ds
.adjust
.indent 0

Through the WRITER interface, I presented Miriam with a story template whose first line
was "Once upon a time," and whose last was "The end."  In between these two lines,
Miriam was able to interpolate any story lines she might wish.  The WRITER interface
generated a procedure whose execution would displayed on the video terminal the text
of the story (after which it could be simply copied to a printer).  When I introduced
the WRITER interface, Miriam objected of the template story ("Once upon a time,/The end.")
"That's not any nice story !"  Agreeing with her, I was still able to argue that we had
a beginning and an end, all we had to do was write the middle part.

     The execution of the WRITER interface was straightforward.  Keying "WRITER"
invoked the interface which cleared the video display and displayed the opening line ,
"Once upon a time," with the procedure line number it would have in the procedure-to-be-
generated.  Miriam keyed her middle part, line by line, and assigned each line a number
for its ordering in the procedure-to-be-generated.  (She typically numbered the lines
serially with unit increments.)  When she keyed "END" instead of some other text, the
WRITER interface displayed "The end." and requested a name for the procedure-to-be-
generated.  After generation and WRITER's termination, the story could be displayed
by keying the new procedure's name.

     From Miriam's first use of the WRITER interface, I will cite two episodes in
extension in order to highlight the difficulties she confronted.  The first difficulty
was what to write.  The second, how to do it, was manifest primarily as ignorance of
spelling.  (So that the following not seem entirely bizarre, you must know that the
original version of WRITER was a very simple procedure name "P" - for "PUT" - which
inserted a keyed line into a pre-existing STORY template.)

Miriam:  Three Little Pigs.
Bob:     O.K.  Once upon a time,...  What happened then ?
Miriam:  I don't know....
Bob:     You have to make up a story ? ... If we want to put a line in here, we can
         say "P" (keying "P" and a DO-IT, carriage return or new line).
Miriam:  Let me put in a P, O.K. ? (a second P).  Can I ?
Bob:     Please don't.
Miriam:  Why ?
Bob:     Let's make a nice story.
Miriam:  No.
Bob:     Instead of just putting random letters in.
Miriam:  (laughing) Can't I ?
Bob:      You want to make a story about P ?
Miriam:  Yeah.
Bob:     O.K.  Once upon a time, P...  What did P do ?
Miriam:  Pee.
Bob:     (in feigned disbelief) P peed ?  Oh no ( a groan).
Miriam:  Once upon a time, P...
Bob:     Would P be a letter of the alphabet ?
Miriam:  Yeah.
Bob:     Why don't you say "Once upon a time, P was a letter of the alphabet..."
Miriam:  Once upon a time, P was sad....  No.  P went to his friend's, Q (laughing).
Bob:     How about this: "P was tired of following Q all the time."
Miriam:  Yeah.
Bob:     And wanted to do something different.
Miriam:  So he started at the beginning of the alphabet...(then, reciting the alphabetic
         litany with a fore-added P), P, ABCD, EFG, HIJK, LMNOP, QRS -
Bob:     Oh, oh... he's following Q again.
Miriam:  P, ABCD -
Bob:     You want to write that story ?
Miriam:  All right .

This "P Story" is highly idiosyncratic, and my prejudice would have judged it as remote
from anything which would engage a child.  It did, however, engage Miriam, as is witnessed
by her later claim of authorship when she showed the text to Robby and he said it was nice.

0     How do we make sense of Miriam's difficulty in conceiving of some content for 
her first story ?  Though she thought of "The Three Little Pigs" as a stereotypical story,
she then said she didn't know where to start - which I take as a sign that the specific
knowledge needed to re-create an often heard or read story may be differently organized
from that necessary to recognize and understand it.  This suggestion (not a novel idea,
and surely not proved by one example) I offer to emphasize that if a child does not start
story writing by connecting that effort to literary stereotypes or her own experiences of
oral description and story telling, she may have to "start from scratch" as Miriam did.
In such a case, the child may give up in frustration without direct help such as my
interventions provided.

     At the level of producing text, Miriam's primary difficulty was spelling.  This
should be no surprise.  If a child writes little more than her name, why should she learn 
to spell letter by letter, when such detailed knowledge of words is not necessary
for speaking or even reading ?  One example of composing a line should suffice to show the
severity of the spelling problem for a novice writer.  (While composing "He started at the
beginning of the alphabet", my prompting was usually inspired by a questioning look and
Miriam's ceasing to type.)

     The following week we returned to story writing at Miriam's request.  Because 
her successive stories show so strongly the character of variations on a theme, I cite
extensively from this session to illustrate that I tried to influence Miriam to create
a story different from her original:
.nofill

Bob:     We have a program here called WRITER.  If you tell it what you want to do,
         it will start off a story that goes "Once upon a time,... The end." and you
         can put in the whole middle part.  O.K. ?
Miriam:  Hey !  Why don't we say "Q was tired of starting at the beginning of the alphabet." ?
Bob:     You want to do something like that ?
Miriam:  Yeah.
Bob:     (After initiating WRITER) This is our story. It says "Once upon a time,... The end."
         It's waiting now for us to tell it more things to say.  Shouyld we make a story 
         about you and your friends ?
Miriam:  I know one, a story.
Bob:     How's it go ?
Miriam:  Close your eyes.
Bob:     Gee, I'd like to see it.  How's the story go ? You just tell me.
Miriam:  A was tired of starting at the bbeginning of the alphabet.  No, was tired of
         following B.  So he started at the end of the alphabet.
Bob:     This sounds like a familiar story.  Would you like to tell a story about our
         house or your kindergarden ?
Miriam:  Anh-uh.
Bob:     Or about Maria ?  Would you like to make a story for Maria ?
Miriam:  Unh-uh.
Bob:     It could be about how she lives in America and wants to go to Spain.
Miriam:  She doe not want to go to Spain.
Bob:     How about... she will go to Spain and still have friends in America ?  Would
         that be a good story ?
Miriam:  Unh-uh.
Bob:     O.K.  You make up any story you want.  It doesn't have to be about letters,
         though.

Miriam went on to compose the "A Story" of Figure I.  Why would any child persist in
elaborating such unpromising material as Miriam's original "P Story" ?  One possibility
is the pervasive burden of spelling to a novice writer, i.e. the choice is to write a
story most of the words of which she recently learned to spell.  A second possibility
is that Miriam owned no alternative, salient script for a story in the specific context
"writing computer stories".  Even though my opposition increased, Miriam went on in
subsequent sessions to compose the "Q Story" and "A1 Story" shown in Figure I.

     Despite the humor of the "A1 Story" (which was a joke composed when Miriam
discarded her backwards alphabet of "A Story" and was amused by the futility of A's
starting at the beginning of the alphabet to avoid following B), I found her elaborations
sterile and boring and intervened in major ways to alter Miriam's writing.  First I
removed the spelling burden by taking on the role of Miriam's amanuensis and put the
composition task in an oral context by introducing a variation of WRITER as a special
tool for writing out the text of songs.  While Miriam recited her favorite kindergarden
song ("Little Rabbit Foofoo/Hopping through the forest/Scooping up the field mice/
And bopping them on the head,/..."), I keyed the text and produced printed output
which Miriam copied and shared with her kindergarden classmates the following day.  When
Miriam hung back from work I had planned in our next session, I followed her direction, thus:

         see how it looks.
Miriam:  (Cheerfully)  O.K. You help me practice.  Let's get the videotape.
Bob:     I won't do it today.  I don't feel like doing any drama because I don't even
         know what we're going to do.  Hey, I just had an idea.  If we wanted to write
         a little play, we could use the WRITER program.  How would that be ?
Miriam:  O.K.  It will be the story of the three bears.
Bob:     You want to do that now ?
Miriam:  It will need five people.
Bob:     Come sit here so you can see what we're doing.
Miriam:  Once upon a time,...
Bob:     We got that already.  Do you want to do any of the keying ?
Miriam:  I may do some.... Why aren't we working on the play while we're writing it ?
Bob:     We should rehearse the play while writing it ?
Miriam:  Yeah.
Bob:     How's it go ?
Miriam:  Once upon a time, three bears lived in a little cottage in the woods....

Miriam's script proved of limited use (the other actresses couldn't read), but the next
day in kindergarden and subsequently when Meg came to play at Logo, the children
dutifully carried their copies about as they were "supposed to" .

     These two interventions of mine liberated Miriam's conception of what it was
possible for a computer written story to be like.  The next week she asked to write
another story.  This story, SCURRY, was her most developed story made during The
Intimate Study.  The extensive citation below shows Miriam with a more liberal conception
of what a story may be like but with her production of text still much encumbered by the
need for extensive spelling advice.

Miriam:  Phooey... When did we get Scurry ?

         Valentine's present for your Mommy.
Miriam:  She's around nine months.

Miriam:  Will you spell "near Valentine's" ?
Bob:     "Near".  You want me to write it ?... There's "near".  You try that.

Bob:     That's the way you write "Valentine's".
Miriam:  A, L, E, N, T, I, N, E,... what's that little thing there ?
Bob:     An apostrophe.  You have to use the shift key, there.  Then there's an "S" on
         the end.
Miriam:  How do you spell "know", not N, O.

     In the preceding citation, we have seen the use of a very simple three part
story form (beginning, middle, end) with a newly flexible middle developed.  How much of 
this script became Miriam's property, in the specific sense that she used it spontaneously ?
Two incidents of succeeding days showed the WRITER template used outside the laboratory.
The first is this:

  Robby called me from Miriam's bedroom: "Dad, come see the puppet show."  They have
played with, even made hand puppets for a while and enjoy giving shows -- whose typical
script has been "Hello.  My name is Owl.  Goodbye."
  Walking through the door unsuspecting, I found the children were playing "Ambush" --
both were lying under covers on the top bunk and crying "BAM ! BAM !" as I walked through
the door.  Riotous laughter.
  Suffering only flesh wounds, I managed to return their fire, then said I thought it 
a dirty trick for them to call me to see a puppet show then shoot me.  Miriam responded,
"This was our puppet show:
          Once upon a time,
          There were two guns.
          Bang.  Bang.
          The end.
Her joke was a spontaneous expression of the WRITER programs story format.  Her use of
it in this explanatory way shows her recognition that it was a shared model of story
structure.
  That same evening, Miriam, who had of late been making "late mother's day presents",
brought me an "early father's day present".  The present was a drawing of one of her
typical flowers with this story:
          Once upon a time,
          A flower was sitting on a hill.
          And someone came and pick it.
          The end.
Miriam could not spell the words, I was told, and had dictated the story to her brother
after drawing the picture.

     Miriam recalls writing no stories at all during her two years of public school
after The Intimate Study.  Before entering third grade in a different program, she took
an entrance examination which required her to write a composition.  The composition,
MY DOG, is presented with SCURRY in Figure II.  MY DOG (a title selected from a list of
ten very general suggestions) shows the thematic influence of the much earlier work both
in the theme chosen and in the initial detail presented.  The episodic continuation beyond
the earlierScurry material derived directly from the requirement that the composition be
one hundred words long.  The two other compositions in Figure II, both written at my request,
show the residual influence of the earlier story script.  Most importantly, that experience
provided a shared, albeit simple, idea of story structure which permitted my criticism that
"the Children's Museum"  simply stopped without ending and that it was possible to use other
beginnings.  I believe my sugeestion that "the Children's Museum" needed a conclusion or 
a summary sentence led Miriam to provide such for "My Friend Liz".

          My Dog

We got a dog near Valente's day for my mother.  We named
the dog Scurry  my little sister is always running around with
Scurry.  Scurry will be three in September.
Once when Scurry had a bath she jumped out
of the bathtub and got me and my mother all
wet.  Sometimes I have to take Scurry for
a walk in the woods and sometimes I have to
feed Scurry and give her water.  Sometimes
my mother takes Scurry and my little 
sister for walks.  Sometimes Scurry runs
away and me, my brother, and my mother
have to go find her.

          the Children's Museum

Once upon a time I went to the Children's Museum.  I had a
lot of fun playing with the computers.  I played "wumpus"
and "tic-tac-toe".  I also played with a big "wonderful
waterful".  I also looked through a pair of glasses about
4' x 4'.  They let us use a weelchair (small in-line drawing)
and a kind of crutch like this (small in-line drawing).
I also played dentist with my father.

          My Friend Liz

Once upon a time I invited my
friend Liz over to the Logo
lab.  I had a lot of unf with
her.  We played with the
computers.  We each bought
2 sodas and a pack of diamints. (dynamints)
I took Lizzy to look all around Logo.
Lizzy and me had a lot of fun.

0     My conclusion is that Miriam's early experience with the WRITER interface at Logo
left her with a stereotypical form for short story and even default thematic elements
(which were easily overridden if occasion required it).  Further, I speculate that the early
presentation of a form with a beginning, middle, and end permitted Miriam's comprehension
of my criticism of the form of one story, as shown by the presence of a summarizing
conclusion in her next composition.

1WRITING LETTERS0

.adjust
     The standard form of a simple letter is only slightly more complicatd than the
general story script of the WRITER interface.  In place of the stereotypical beginning
"Once upon a time," the letter head is dated and introduced with the salutation,
"Dear _______,".  A letter typically concludes with a conventional closing.  For "The end."
is substituted a phrase which suggests the relation of writer and recipient and the
writer's signature.  The LETTER interface functioned as did WRITER with the added
complications of asking for the weekday, date and the recipient's name and requiring
a manual signature to complete the letter.

     Miriam used LETTER to write letters to a school friend, to her great grandmother
in a distant city and even to make a supper invitation for Logo colleagues whose paths
crossed ours too infrequently to be certin of meeting them.  But with one unusual exception
not too much should be made of the utility to a child of letter writing.  (The telephone
is easier to use and can be a more personal and immediate contact.)  Even though her
choices were significant in selecting which one of several possible activities we would
pursue on any particular day, Miriam's letters were written at my request as part of 
our study, as her earlier stories had been.

     Miriam's favorite school friend was Maria, whose parents barely spoke English
and who returned with her to their native Spain in the middle of our study.  Miriam
could not play after school where Maria lived, and it was nearly impossible to arrange
by 'phone for Maria to visit us.  Miriam gave a letter to Maria at school to arrange a
visit to our house and later sent her a letter in Spain.  In her three letters to Maria,
Miriam's primary difficulty was with spelling.  The extent of the spelling problem can
be appreciated by comparing the text of Miriam's first two letters to Maria with the list
of words I spelled for her.  (See Figure III).  Miriam requested help for spelling nearly all
the content words (nouns and verbs) and even with the common preposition "with" and the
auxillliary "will".

     0In her letters to Maria, the significance of the heading date never rose as an
issue.  Miriam answered the questions about the week day and date; they were easy questions,
part of a simple convention of no obvious significance.  As she dictated to me her letter
to G.G., we became embroiled in the complications of relative dating:
.nofill
.indent 2
.ss
Miriam:  (To Bob who is keying) Say," Mommy had a birthday yesterday."
Bob:     Today's her birthday.
Miriam:  Yeah, but it will get there (where GG is ) tomorrow.
Bob:     But we told her at the top of the letter what day it is, so she knows what
         day you write it.
Miriam:  Oh.
Bob:     That's one of the reasons we put the date on, so she can figure out things
         like that.  It's a good hint for her to figure out what's going on.... Well,
         do you want to say "Mommy has a birthday today" or "Mommy has a birthday
         tomorrow" ?
Miriam:  Had one today.
Bob:     (keying) Mommy has a birthday --
Miriam:  (interrupting to correct) Had !
Bob:     Sorry. I thought you said "has".  "Had a birthday today".

Through this accident, Miriam had the opportunity to learn how what first appeared as 
merely a conventional feature of the given letter structure solved a comprehensible
problem to which she was sensitive.

     Miriam's most fully developed letter, that to DANNY AND MARGARET (See Figure IV),
joined decoration, created by a procedure she had written, with text.  This new format
(my suggestion) made Miriam's letter more like those early presents she had delighted in
making - with the addition of a significantly extended textual component.  When she later
made party invitations on the computer, Miriam kept this format.  Spelling remained a
primary problem, enough of a problem that she changed her selection of specific
phrases to circumvent spelling uncertainties.  Originally, for example, we planned
to ask Danny and Margaret to supper on Wednesday.  Miriam chose to refer to that day 
as the "31 of August" (copying "August" from her earlier use of it in the heading)
to avoid asking for help in spelling Wednesday.

     It is difficult to trace any specific element of this computer letter writing
in Miriam's letters of later date.  She writes few letters, and most are written with a specific purpose (which would tend to obscure any residual thematic influences).  Examples of
the standard salutation and closing are so ubiquitous that no influence on the form 
of Miriam's letters should be claimed.  However,  Miriam's understanding of relative dating and
its relation to the heading date is secure, in fact it now directs the form of her
letters in this specific sense.  She recently wrote a thank-you note for Christmas
presents.  No relative dating was used and the heading was undated.  In immediate contrast
is the letter copied below:

                              1/1/80
          Dear Dara,
               Did you get your Christmas
          letter ?  How are you ?  I'm 
          fine.  I might come up next week.
          Do you think I could visit you ?
          Last time I tried to visit you you
          were not home and I would like
          to see you.  PS.  How is your
          family ?  PPS.  Turn over
          the paper.

The reverse of the paper contains a large drawing of a "queen", duplicating a small
decoration which Miriam had interposed between the salutation and the heading date.
When I asked her at what point in composing the letter she wrote down the heading date
and why she did so, Miriam responded, "When I was finished the letter, because I said 
I might come up NEXT week and she has to know when I wrote it."

1DISCUSSION
0

     The issue of computer's suitability as a medium for writing instruction is
confronted in an extreme form when the specific use is for introducing a child to
writing.  We have seen one possible advantage of a programmed machine is the capability
for presenting the structure of written material as conventional scripts.  Through
presenting a conventional form, into which a child could insert personalized content,
the hope would be to engage the child in a creation which could be valuable to her.
Critics might argue that such an approach is entirely cosmetic, disguising the child's
real ignorance with a covering of some other person's knowledge,mechanically reproduced.
Such is a penetrating criticism, but its focus is more on the finished product than 
on the genetic intent of the tool.  The intention is to engage the child in the creation
of nearly conventional artifacts through which activity it might come to perceive
what the organization is, typically, and what the significance of the elements is.
(The clearest example is Miriam's finding out, in composing her letter to GG, that
dated headings serve to disambiguate relative dating when the message is in the post
for some uncertain time.)  Further, if the child as author can create text which she
is willing to dwell upon as reader, she may gradually perceive the structure of the
text.  For example, if a child perceives a short story as having a beginning 
("Once upon a time,"), her part (the middle), and an end ("The end."), she should
gradually vary and then dominate the beginning and end, which were not originally
her own.  Thus an initially unstructured form of expression would be fit, piecemeal,
into those conventional forms which have been found effective for communication.
The general view of learning to write is this: the learner gradually perceives 
how to analyze a form of text into parts and eventually may discover or invent
meaningful interpretations and applications for those parts.

     Even if one grants that computers may be useful in introducing writing
to children, one must ask how extensible the approach is.  What else is there to
write beside stories and letters ?  With a utilitarian focus, other applications
may be hard to imagine.  Computer produced letters may be useful to a child as
a grown-up disguise, i.e. they may permit her  to send off requests for information, etc.
that would have a grown-up appearance and would more likely be honored than a letter
obviously sent by a child.  I find it hard to imagine any other "practical" advantage
a child could gain in her everyday life from writing.  If you look at text creation
as another medium for enriching social relations, artistic expression, and as a path
to self-knowledge, the possibilities are more promising.  Miriam recently made me
a Joke Book as a present.  Does not the making of books and booklets offer enormous
opportunity for personalized art-work and composition ?  Title pages need decoration.
Very large scale fonts could be done in intricate detail permitting complex colorings
(by machine or by crayon).  The mingling of graphics and text has enriched western art
for thousands of years; similar work by children would not only be a joy to them 
in itself, but it could even sensitize them to artistic traditions that now seem
remote even to many adults.

     What types of books might children make ?  Surely they need not be restricted
to jokes (though such would remain a popular genre).  Some might be mathematical and
artistic; I can easily imagine Robby creating a book of his symmetrical INSPI designs 
with commentaries on which input values to his procedures generate the most attractive
designs and why they do so.  Children's story books often have elaborate pictures and
simple texts.  Could not a child also make stories and illustrate each action sentence
with a drawing (mechanically made or otherwise) ?  Cross-word puzzles would be another
natural computer-based product for a child.  The computer could neatly stack the
little boxes and list the clues while the child did the hard intellectual work.
Other puzzles, mazes and jokes would be ideally served by inverted text and mirror
image fonts.  For example, a child could declare in a standard font the riddle,
"How do you get down from a horse ?" and print the answer, "You dont.  You get down
from a duck !" in some topsy-turvy font.  How about anti-commercials (a genre Robby
loves) ?  I can imagine him making a poster showing very ugly creatures singing
(to the tune of a recent commercial):
.nofill

          Tab, Tab makes your breath stink !

     I believe computers offer a promising medium for enhancing functional literacy
through improving writing.  I suspect there is room for the development of application
specific language facilities which will render the computer's power more accessible 
to children without limiting their initiative.  But I do not believe that the development
of such lexical or word worlds will escape confronting major problems.  Recall all the
difficulty Miriam had with spelling.  She could spell a few one, two and three letter
words, but not much else.  She was able to guess at some letters - usually the initial
and terminal consonants - but she required spelling help on nearly every content word
of all she wrote.  I could help her because I recoded her oral/aural words as alphabetic
letter strings.  If a computer has no ears, must it not - like a dictionary - require
you to spell a word so that it can tell you WHICH word you want to know how to spell ?
A computer spelling advisor may help with a nearly correct word in a nearly comprehensible
sentence.  The problem of advising children about their spelling is more difficult than that.
Consider, for example, Miriam's story about SCURRY.  Let's substitute an asterisk for
the residue of every word (what follows an initial consonant, if anything) where she
asked for advice.  Here's what it looks like:
.nofill
.ss
          Once upon a time,
          We g*  a dog n*  v*  day
          And we did not *  w* to c*  it
          *  a w*  we d*  to c*  it S*.
          And we f*  *  it.
          The end.

.ds

It would require a very intelligent spelling advisor to make sense of this indecipherable
context.  Grappling with such problems may be one way the discipline of Artificial Intelligence
can help to humanize the computer presence.  Whatever form an effective spelling advisor
might take, the constraints it generates should be considered in organizing the means of
access to knowledge in any associated automated dictionary.

     We have seen in the material presented here an example of how one child
was introduced to writing in a computer rich setting.  This example highlights the 
suitability of computers for an introduction to writing which separates the structural
elements of composition from its contents.  Specific later developments of this one
child's writing suggest her earlier experiences remained important as stereotypes 
of writing forms.
