Å ^NOTES ON INTRODUCING AGASSIZ KIDS TO TI COMP
Å x
Å x<These Çnotes Çare Çsketchy, Çsince Çthey Çwere Çfor Çthe Çmost Çpart Çtaken Çdown Çafter--
Å xsometimes Çby Ça Çfew Çhours--the Çsession Çwith Çthe Çkid.Ç  In Çalmost Çall Çcases, ÇJaffrey
Å xwas Çtaking Çnotes Çfull-time.Ç  In Çaddition, Çsome Çof Çthe Çsessions Çwere Çtape-recorded.
Å xFrom April 29, the first day I spent with Çthe kids through the sessions on May 13, ÇI
Å xwas Çby Çrequest Çfor Çthe Çmost Çpart Çunaware Çof Çthe Çconceptual Çcategories Çused Çand
Å xindividual assessments made Çby Jaffrey Çand Sherry in Çtheir previous Çwork with Çthe
Å x"group of Çfive" Çand their Çreactions Çto various Çcomputer Çtoys.  I Çdid, Çhowever, Çknow
Å xwho Çthe Çfive Çwere.Ç  Occasionally, Çtoo, Ça Çremark Çabout Ç"intelligibility" Çor Ç"opacity"
Å xwÅ(as Çmade Çin Çmy Çpresence.Ç  I Çinferred Çthat Çthese Çwere Çamong Çthe Çconceptual
Å xcategories Çand Çhad Ça Çvague, Çthough Çgenerally Çcorrect Çsense Çof Çwhat Çwas Çmeant Çby
Å xthese.  I had also skimmed Çsome of the early protocols Çwritten up by Jaffrey Çabout
Å xa Çmonth Çpreviously, Çbut Çhad Çno Çclear Çrecollection Çof Çthem.Ç  All Çthis Çaside, Çthese
Å xnotes Çwere Çmade Çpretty Çmuch Çin Çthe Çdark, Çwhich Çfact Çgives Çthem Çwhatever Çvalue
Å xthey Çmight Çhave.Ç  They Çshould Çbe Çread Çin Çconjunction Çwith ÇJaffrey's Çnotes, Çsince
Å xthose notes Çundoubtedly Çconvey a Çmuch Çclearer picture Çof Çthe range Çand Çsequence
Å xof each child's activities.>

Å x
Å xI Çintroduced ÇMS Çand Çused Çit Çto Çproduce Ça Çgrid.Ç  I Çasked ÇB. Çwhat Çkind Çof Çshape Çhe
Å xwanted Çto Çmake.Ç  His Çfirst Çcomment Çwas, Ç"Leave Çit Çlike Çit Çis."Ç  In Çquestioning Çhim, ÇI
Å xgot Çthe Çimpression Çthat ÇB. Çthought Çthis Çwould Çbe Ça Çbox.Ç  What ÇI Çdidn't Çclarify Çwas
Å xthat the grid itself would not appear.  Later I adopted the practice of setting things
Å xup so that Ça sprite Çwith the Çshape being designed Çwould appear Çalongside the Çgrid.
Å xAnyway, ÇI Çexplained Çto ÇB. Çthat Çthat Çwould Çbe Çinvisible.Ç  B. Çthen Çsaid Çhe'd Çlike Çto

Å xactually Çlooked Çlike Çone) ÇI Çtold Çhim Çhow Çto Çget Ça Çsprite Çto Ç"carry" Çit.Ç  I Çexplained
Å xwhat Çhe Çcould Çdo Çwith Çit Çand Çhe Çsaid Çhe Çwould Çchange Çits Çcolor.Ç  He Çdecided Çto
Å xchange Çit Çto Çorange, Çwhich Çwas Çone Çof Çthe Çfew Çcolors ÇI Çhad Çalready Çshown Çhim.Ç  As

Å x<Mrs.  Cox brought in Çthis group of 5 Çseventh graders.  She had Çtold me that Çthere

Å xthe 7th grade group;  see below).
Å x
Å xRÅ(CL remembered many Çof the commands Çfrom before.  She Çseemed to have Çno
Å xproblem Çwith Çthe Çidea Çof Çusing ÇRANDOM Ças Çinput Çto Çthe Çcommands Çshe Çknew Çnor
Å xwith the concept that you can use numbers instead of colornames.
Å x
Å xOne Çdelightful Çthing Çwas Çto Çsee Ç"shift-U" Ç(the Çdelete Çkey) Çpicked Çup Çby ÇRCL Ç(?Ç  or
Å xwas it April--consult Jaffrey) as a verb.  Matthew
Å x
Å xThis Çwas Ça Çone-shot Çdeal Çfor ÇMatthew, Ça Çthird-grader.Ç  He Çhad Çused ÇSETS Ç90, Çso
Å xwÅ(hen ÇI Çintroduced ÇRT Çhe Çtried ÇRT Ç90. ÇI Çwasn't Çclear Çon Çhow Çto Çbring Çthe

Å xiÅ(nstead Çto Çtry Çgoing ÇRT Ç100.Ç  Afterwards Çhe Çtried ÇRT Ç4 Çand Çthen ÇRT Ç9. ÇI Çtoo
Å xqÅ(uickly Çqueried Çhim Çabout Çthe Çadditive Çquality Çof Çgiving ÇRT Çcommands, Çand
Å xintroduced Çthe Çprimitive ÇHEADING.Ç  Point Çwas Çcompletely Çlost.Ç  Unsurprisingly, ÇM's
Å xfirst response to "how far right" the sprite was now "heading" was 9.
Å x
Å xBNY
Å NPAGE 9

Å x
Å xThis Çwas ÇBNY's Çsecond Çtime.Ç  Like Çthe Çfirst Çtime, Çhis Çfavorite Çactivity Çwas Çto Çmake
Å xhis own Çshape.Ç  This Çtime Çwe Çused Çthe Çfollowing Çset Çof Çabbreviations, Çwhich ÇI Çhave
Å xused consistently Çwith all Çthe kids Çexcept the Ç7th grade Çgroup who Çhave been Çtold
Å xthey can use either:
Å x
Å xT = TELL
Å xSH = CARRY
Å xC = SETCOLOR
Å xSP = SETSPEED
Å xBG = TELL BACKGROUND SETC
Å x
Å xBNY is not nearly as impressed with changing the background colors as most of the
Å xothers.
Å x
Å xLate in the session (which Seymour was conducting) Seymour suggested that BNY
Å xmight like to give a sprite a speed.  Even though Seymour had been using a sheet
Å xof paper with the new abbreviations, BNY typed in SAT--evidently a corruption of
Å xSETS, which he had been using a full week before.
Å x
Å xBNY, like almost all the kids I've worked with, seem to think that merely a number
Å ;PAGE 10

Å xwill suffice, i.e. that no LOGO primitive is required.
Å x
Å xAt the end of the session, BNY had set one sprite going at a speed of 1 and
Å xanother--which, I believe was not traveling precisely parallel to the first--at a
Å xmuch higher speed--I think around eighty.  He conceived the idea of having a race
Å xand tried counting how many times the faster sprite was moving across the screen
Å xas the slower one inched across.  After a while his counting lost very close
Å xcorrespondence to the actual movement of the fast sprite and since after 49 he
Å xsaid 30 (a kind of memory mistake I had completely forgotten about making myself),
Å xthe point couldn't really be followed through.  I also think that the way sprites
Å xwrap on the machine is really opaque and wonder if the screen shouldn't be
Å xconceived as the visible portion of a globe for the purposes of wrapping.
Å x
Å xMay 8, Thursday
Å x
Å xBNY
Å x
Å xI knew that BNY was coming in first and wanted to see his reaction to a dramatic
Å xeffect so I used SHOUT to get all the sprites, which were carrying turtles, to spray
Å xout in a circle and then wrap against a background regularly flashing random colors.
Å xWell, BNY liked it but didn't go wild over it the way some kids do.   I told him how
Å ;PAGE 11

Å xto change the turtles into planes, which he did.  Then, as he was watching the
Å xcircle phase recurred--he really loved this.  I made a little show of "making the
Å xuniverse run backwards" by giving changing the speed of the sprites to their
Å xnegative speed.  I think the idea was a throwaway, but he was very happy to see
Å xthe circle appear again.
Å x
Å xImmediately after, though, BNY asked to do what clearly is his favorite thing--
Å xmaking shapes.  I notice him intently at work, pausing now and then, putting finger
Å xto front tooth and reflecting, then back to work, sometimes with what appears to
Å xme to be mildly amused fascination.  Now and then he bites his lip in concentration.
Å xBefore any particular shape was clear I asked him what he was drawing.  He said,
Å x"A design".  A little later, a fairly neat looking robot, a sketch of which I have,
Å xemerged.
Å x
Å xI asked B. what he wanted to do.  He wanted to make it move and gave it a speed
Å xof 1.  I then told him about RT and LT.  Right off he tried LT 90, which I tried to
Å xpursue, but with no success.  He next gave the sprite a speed of 6.  Jaffrey asked
Å xhim whether he thought this was fast enough.  He said yes.
Å x
Å xThen I asked him what the figure was.  He said, "A man with his arms stretched
Å xout," and said he'd like to make it juggle.  I suggested making some new shapes
Å ;PAGE 12

Å xand calling new sprites so that the balls or pins the man was juggling could move
Å xseparately.  BNY didn't want to do this, though.  He very clearly stated that he
Å xwanted to get the same shape back, which he did with my help and filled in a
Å xcouple of squares to achieve the effect he wanted.
Å x
Å xI told him about BG, the program to change background colors which seems to be
Å xmost kids' favorite thing.  He wasn't at all interested.  I suggested that maybe he'd
Å xlike to try getting the sprite to go faster.  He then gave it a speed of 70.  I asked
Å xwhether it was better to get things to go fast or slow and he said fast, but, I think,
Å xwithout conviction.
Å x
Å xGroup of Five 7th Graders
Å x
Å xToday the central topic of discussion was why certain high numbers given as input
Å xto SETS cause heading to reverse and speed to diminish.  Maria wondered whether
Å xeven numbers made the sprite go one way and odd numbers another.  Sherman
Å xwondered whether prime numbers might not have some special effect.  Maria
Å xasked whether you could ask the computer questions.  I said you could ask some
Å xkinds--what kinds did she want to ask?  She wanted to know why it did things like
Å xthat.  I said we couldn't ask it that.  Sherman, Mike and Maria are most interested
Å xin this whole issue.  Francois and Tony are not all that interested.  I notice that
Å ;PAGE 13

Å xMaria and Sherman, despite their interesting hypotheses have no systematic way
Å xof going about testing them.  Sherman did SETH 270.  Maria says, "270's not a
Å xprime number, is it?"  Various numbers are tried by Sherman.  I suggest that maybe
Å xsomeone would like to keep a record of what's happening to help figure things out.
Å xSherman sagely points to his head and says "I'll remember".  Mike goes second to
Å xlast and despite lack of time is the only one to begin taking a systematic approach
Å xto figuring out at which point things change.  He's aware of this, because
Å xafterwards he came up and was fishing for some praise.  I told him I thought he
Å xwas on the right track.
Å x
Å xRCL (and initial notes on Roy)
Å x
Å xRCL asked me right off, "How do you talk to a sprite?  I'm pretty rusty..."  I told
Å xher, but my impression is that she is not rusty at all.  She asks me questions, I
Å xthink, in part to show off and in part to make a connection.  This time she's taking
Å xturns with Roy who is exuberant, perhaps a bit scattered and the first kid I've
Å xseen who types in whatever he can into the machine.  Roy is also tremendously
Å xconcerned with whether the computer can answer your questions.

Å xRCL seems supremely confident today.  She's fascinated by the concept of random,
Å xwhich I briefly introduced the last time.  She's wondering whether you can get the
Å ;PAGE 14

Å xcomputer to get a sprite to take a random shape or a random speed.  Since we
Å xnow had abbreviations at our disposal, somehow the idea of writing a program
Å xcame up and I instructed her in writing a program to make all sprites become
Å xinvisible.  I suggested calling it VANISH, wh ich is what Seymour always calls this,
Å xbut RCL suggested the abbreviation VS, which I said was fine.  Between us (mostly
Å xat my direction) she typed in the one-line program.  She then typed in VS.  It
Å xworked and RCL looked up at me, winked and beamed.
Å x
Å xVery competently, she types in T 27 SH :BALL C :PURPLE then looks up and asks,
Å x"Did I spell purple right?"
Å x
Å xSince she had decided to talk to SPRITE 27, it kept getting wiped out by prior (but
Å xinvisible) shapes.  I explained that lower numbered sprites took precedence and
Å xshe volunteered:  "Oh, so it's going behind the other shapes?"
Å x
Å xToday, I'm letting RCL do pretty much as she wants.  She decided to talk to more
Å xsprites and proceeds backwards from 27.  I then told her how to use a list to talk
Å xto more than one sprite at a time.  She did this and wondered how to talk to
Å xindividual sprites within the list, so I told her about F and BF, which she
Å xunderstood and used immediately.

Å xAt one point I was telling her about "asking" the computer what the heading was.
Å xShe asked, "How do you ask it what speed it wants to go?"  I asked, "Does it Å&wantÅ'Å'
Å xto go a speed?"  She said, "Well, I guess not."  Then she asked me, "How do you
Å xget the list of random colors?"  I tried to get her to clarify, she didn't , and since I
Å xrealized what she wanted I reminded her about PONS.  We did PONS, got the list
Å xof colors and numbers and RCL asked, "How am I going to remember this?"   I told
Å xher, "Well, you can always type PONS."
Å x
Å xRCL was wondering about what the effect of shift on all keys would be.  I
Å xsuggested she try, not thinking of shift-Q.  Well, shift-Q crashed it.  I explained
Å xwhat was lost--mostly the abbreviations.  She had no trouble  reverting to the
Å xlonger form primitives.

Å x
Å xBLE
Å x
Å xBLE took immediately to the new abbreviations.  I have noticed that he says the
Å xnames of the abbreviations after he has typed in a line with my help--as if he is
Å xtranslating from code to something more closely approximating natural language.
Å x

Å xBLE  put a truck on the screen.  It has been a couple of weeks since his first
Å xencounter.  This time he's much faster.  I can't be sure why:  because the
Å xabbreviations make typing easier, because of greater familiarity, because he's in
Å xbetter spirits, because I am.
Å x
Å xHe next wanted to make his own hape, saying at first that he wanted to make a
Å xflying saucer.  When it was clear that this wasn't turning out, he modified his plans
Å xand said he would make a building.  During the course of filling in the grid he
Å xmoved from an unsystematic approach to filling in a solid area to an extremely
Å xsystematic, though slightly uneconomical approach.  He moved inwards by squirals,
Å xbut each time overshot by one and had to erase.
Å x
Å xHe then asked to get more sprites on the screen and wondered how to get them
Å xto be different colors.  I said there was a "mre complicated but faster way, using a
Å xprocedure I had written called SHOUT." Or, we could talk to the sprites one by
Å xone, which was simpler but took longer.  He said, "Let's do it the simpler way."
Å x
Å xDarnell
Å x
Å xDarnell came in with his friend Page while I was just finishing typing in
Å xabbreviations.  Darnell couldn't wait to get his hands on the machine.  When he did,
Å ;PAGE 17

Å xhe first followed instructions, but did lots of random typing and played with the
Å xknobs on the TV display to create a broken TV effect, wh ich he really loved.  He's
Å xextremely independent:  I offered to help him by pointing out the keys to him but
Å xhe fairly resolutely refused.  I got a little worried when I saw him eyeing the
Å xon/off switch on the extra-memory box.  I explained if he pressed that, the
Å xcomputer would forget all I had taught it and would cost me lots of work.  he said,
Å x"oh, you didn't tell me that" and then stayed away and warned Page away from the
Å xswitch but seemed tempted the whole time.
Å x
Å xDarnell was the first kid I've seen who really tried talking to the machine,
Å xapparently with some expectation that it would respond.
Å x
Å xOccasionally, he7d turn to Jaffrey and ask to play some other game.  He would
Å xfocus occasionally, but never for long.
Å x
Å xBNY
Å x
Å xI asked him what he wanted to do.  He said, "I like making things a lot."  I asked
Å xwhether he liked making other things too, like things out of wood.  Laconic yes.
Å xAnd drawing?  Mhmm.

Å xThen we had a strange crash, which was actually pretty attractive, so this turned
Å xout to be a fairly short sess ion.
Å x
Å xRoy
Å x
Å xJaffrey and Sherry both have notes on this.  It was a pretty wild time:  a gerbil
Å xgot loose and we spent some time catching it.  Roy seemed very much to want the
Å xmachine to respond to him personally.  He'd type all kinds of stuff in.  His friend
Å xtyped in his name.  Roy typed in something about the computer eating dogfood.
Å xMy sense is that this guy might possibly get into using a text editor, but it's hard
Å xfor me to imagine him focussing enough to use LOGO.
Å x
Å x**** Afterwards, Sherry, Jaffrey and I had some discussion much of which Sherry
Å xrecorded.  Some convergence on idea of sensual kids--who get off on color and, on
Å xthis machine, artifactual stuff--having more difficulty focussing on controlling
Å xparticular properties through use of formal language
