Class #1......April 03

1. He was introduced to the 6 commands on the buttonbox.  He asked
several times "what was that for", referring to the turtle,
buttonbox, etc.

2. Back command did not work and we had to take the picture from the buttonbox.

3. He started to use the buttons and in the beginning he could not make
the relation between the action of pushing one button and the turtle
movement.  He played with the turtle for a while and then we gave him
some games:  eg. "kick the ball", parking the turtle between posts
(making the turtle go through the gate).  He did all these games without
much difficulty.

4. He liked the BEEP command and when hir teacher was around, he called
her and show what he could do with the turtle. He moved  and beeped it.

5. He had several words for describing the BEEP action of the turtle:
beep, toot and whistle.

Ideas for future projects:  use the turtle to draw pictures

1. We had the command BACK and he said today he could move the turtle
back.  It was the first command he tried.  It was interesting how he
noticed it because the picture on the keyboard was upside down (same
position as the picture for FORWARD).

2. We let him play with the turtle moving it as he would like.  He was
trying to "understand" the inverse action of the commands.  For
instance, he would go  forward several steps and go backward several
steps(not necessarily the same as used in forward).

3. We gave him the gate game.  In order for him to face the turtle in
the direction of the gate he had to turn it and he asked  which way
to turn.  We said for him to try.  He tried the wrong one but
immediately he turned to the correct direction.

4. He would place the turtle between the posts and would beep the horn,
laughing.

5.  He liked the idea of playing with the turtle and make it go out of
his sight.

6. Seems he had some difficulty in noticing where the turtle was
facing.  We turned the lights on and that seems to help him.

Class #3......April 10

1. Offered choice of working with floor turtle or screen.  Chose the
former, inspite of presence on the screen of a picture of 2 houses.
"After I have worked with the turtle I will draw". 

2. We showed him how to type FD 10.  He asked it he could have the
overlay.  Did not notice missing "beep" lable (out of action because of
loose wire).

3. Used longer steps (unit for screen is FD 50) -- "I want the turtle to go faster" We
changed the program and made it FD 10, i.e. unit for floor. Now he can
get more rapid response.

4. Maneuvered turtle randomly at first.  Gate set up and as he started to
maneuver the turtle through the gate he noticed missing "whistle" which
was part of his "going through the gate" procedure.

5. Problem with a faulty turtle made the maneuver very tricky (veered
to the left).

"I think it is the gate"

"Oh come on" with much laughter.

6. When turtle turned towards him so that he would see lamps he said:
"Oh the lamps are on".  When he could see only one -- he said "only one
lamp on".

7. Asked for ball, "play basketball".  Used turtle to hit the ball:
difference between use of "turn" here and in 5 above.  Here turned when
near the goal object; in 5 backup first ? meaning?  Car model.

8.  Knows back is reverse of forward.  "Turns" at first by trial and
error. Later, prediction more accurate when the turtle was facing same
direction as he. 

9. Enjoyed pushing turtle out of sight saying "bye turtle!"

10. Had to be stopped after 30 minutes to go for an evaluation.  "Will
you come tomorrow?"
