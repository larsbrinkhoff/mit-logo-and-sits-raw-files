Dear Phil:
	Well, I was rather disappointed that you didn't show up in court
so we could settle the matter of how you would pay me. Since you
both failed to file answer and failed to show in court you have
been, as you know, judged in default. As a result, I have (after
considerable delay) obtained a so-called Writ of Execution (copy enclosed)
with which I can begin supplemental process in order to collect the debt.
This seems rather silly, since it is time consumeing for me,
and rather painful for you.
	You will note that the total specified in the Writ is 403.55;
this is because the court costs are charged against you. It will also
be true that the costs of supplemnetal process will be charged
against you (further court costs, sheriff's fees, etc). You
will also note that interest is due from the date of the judgement.
Therefore, I suggest that you clear this matter up as soon as
possible.
	I'm not tring to be nasty about this, I would just like to
get my money; so far you have been extremly uncooperative, so I
don't intend to wait a long time before taking further legal action to
collect. I would be very happy and consider the debt paid in full
if I receive a cashier's check for $400 within 10 days or so;
if this is impossible I suggest you contact me immediately so
we can arrange some other means of payment.
