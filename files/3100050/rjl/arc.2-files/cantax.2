Dear Sirs:

	Enclosed please find copies of forms TP4A and NR4
for the year 1975. It is my understanding that, according to
the terms of the United States-Canada tax treaty,
Article VII, I am "exempt from ... tax
upon compensation ... if not present therein for a period or
periods not exceeding a total of 183 days" (I was present in
Canada for about 7 days) and "compensation received for
such personal services does not exceed $5000" (which is also the case).
	I was employed By C.E.G.E.P. Edouard Montpetit
under a consulting contract; I provided computer software maintence
and development. The total sum received by me during 1975 was
$xxxxxx.xx, which included expenses. According to the provision
I have cited above, I believe the full tax collected (xxx.xx Provincial
and xxx.xx Federal) should be
refunded. Please inform me if you require additional information.
