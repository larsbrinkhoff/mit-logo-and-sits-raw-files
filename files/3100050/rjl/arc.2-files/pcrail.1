Dear Sir:

	On 11 January 1976 I sent you a check for $9.00 in response

to your ad in the January issue of Model Railroader. In that ad you

offered 6 issues of your publication and one free gift for $9.00.

However, it appears that my subscription will run out after I recieve

my fourth issue. I realize that you have increased the price of you

magazine since the time you placed that ad, but I believe you are

obligated to fullfill that offer, espcially considering the new

federal regulations concerning mail order business. Therefore I think

that you should extend my subscription by 2 issues according to

your orginal offer.

	I do enjoy your magazine, and I would like to take this

opportunity to extend my subscription under your latest free gift

offer. I therefore enclose the provided form and a check for $19.00

and the mailing label from the latest issue. If, however, you do

not intend to give me the 2 extra issue I am entitled to by my first

subscription, please do not cash my check until we have settled the matter.

	Therefore, if all goes well, my subscription should be extended

by 14 issues, to issue 37.
