1Profile; Holly0

Holly is one of the brightest, most successful students in our project
(her most recent national achievement test scores placed her in the
99th percentile).  In her regular school work, Holly loves reading and
writing, but finds mathematics and science "boring".  She enjoys
"playing with words," and prides herself on her creativity and the
uniqueness of her ideas.

While Holly was one of the most able LOGO students, she was one of the
least enthusiastic.  She carried out two interesting and unique turtle
geometry projects, but announced that she was "bored with drawing
pictures".  She rarely initiated project ideas, but responded very well
to suggestions.  She carried out two complex "advanced" projects:
programming the computer to play "tictactoe", and writing a program
that would generate a series of "silly" stories, by randomly
substituting nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. for those in the original story.

Holly seemed to like the idea of each of her large projects, and
was very quick to learn the LOGO commands and programming ideas
necessary to carry them out.  Although she found the necessary detailed
work of planning, typing, testing and debugging to be quite tedius, she
worked quite steadily over a number of class periods, and finished both
projects quite satisfactorily.

Holly was always extremely responsive to "testing" and to the teacher's
sugestions.  She would often understand and absorb a new idea at the
first hearing -- resolving minor problems by experimentation.  Holly
was also responsive to error messages from the computer, corrected her
mistakes when she could, and was conscientious about asking for help
when she needed it.

Holy also enjoyed helping others.  She developed a strong relationship
with Tammy, and regularly helped her with the details of her work.

1I -- Holly's Working Style0
.br
Holly's way of working in the LOGO classes offered a clear
demonstration of the skills and strategies that make her an extremely
successful student.

11.0 Holly chooses interesting projects and sticks with them.
She has a sense of what it means to be "creative", and has the ability
to carry it off.  Her ideas are always a little bit different than
those of her peers, and Holly values this.  Holy recognizes the value
of completing a project, and is willing to continue with the work
necessary to fill in the details of an idea, even after it is no longer
"fun" or "creative".  In this way, her completed work tends to have a
superior quality.  On the other hand, often while completing a project,
Holly would declare that the necessary work was "boring".

12.0 Holly is willing to explore on her own. She attends to
error messages, and corrects herself when she can.  When she gets stuck
she immediately asks for help -- and is usually aware of exactly where
the confusion is.

From the very beginning of classes, Holly's dribble file reveals a lot
of exploratory activities.  She would try out new commands, and was
able to debug spelling or syntax errors by interpreting the error
messages she received.  If she was confused the first time a particular
bug appeared, she would usually know exactly what to do the second time.

13. 0 Holly follows directions explicitly. She absorbs new
approaches without being confused.  She applies the same approach of
confident exploration to new ideas she has been taught, that she
applies to her own experimentation.  Only when a bug appears does she
question what she is doing, and ask for help.  Holly's two large
projects, her TICTACTOE game, and her MADLIB story generator, both
involved her with the use of new LOGO commands, new syntax and new
programming ideas.  She seemed to absorb most of these ideas on first
exposure -- copying a formula, rather than analyzing.  Occasionally
this led to a bug which she did not understand.  Usually it led to
success in using the new idea with little difficulty.

14. 0Holly adds her own creative variations to other people's
ideas.  Holly can easily find a new "wrinkle" or a creative way to do
something.  Her first project (SMILY -- see below), was a totally
unique way to draw a face.  She used an extremely clever set of words,
to make a funny set of stories, in her madlib project.  In this way,
Holly was able to adapt an idea -- my idea of a madlib procedure, for
example -- and make it uniquely and specially her own.

There were, however, some aspects of Holly's work that tended to
interfere with her success as a student.

15. 0Holly did not show much initiative in choosing projects.
When finished with one piece of work, Holly tended to feel aimless, at
loose ends, until she had redirected her energy.  At these times she
seemed to want direction from another person.  When offered a choice of
alternatives, she was able to easily choose among them -- but the
choices themselves did not come easily to her.

16. 0Holly's major approach seemed to be "exploratory" rather
than "analytical."  She was very comfortable at the "try it out, and
debug it," approach; but much less successful with planning and using
analytical techniques to solve problems, and avoid difficulties.  (See
below for clear examples of this difficulty in Holly's work with turtle
geometry).

17. 0Holly tended to get bored with the details of a project,
long before it was completed. She would persevere out of a
committment to "completeness", rather than out of a sense of enjoyment
of her work.  This left her with a rather anti-climatic feeling at the
end of a project, rather than the satisfaction of a job well done,
which she could have had.

In part, this kind of feeling is a result of her lack of analysis --
she would start a long project, intrigued with the idea, not
realizing how much detailed work was involved.  Partly it was a result
of my suggesting complex projects to her, to give her a better sense of
what she could accomplish with the computer.  In general, it seems that
she had some difficulty in finding the proper balance between the
originality and power of what she wanted the computer to do -- and the
complexity of detail needed to bring it off.  (See a discussion of
Holly's TICTACTOE and MADLIB projects for more detailed description of
this kind of dilemma.)

1II -- Holly's Work with Turtle Geometry0
.br
Holly started out with an excellent sense of how to manipulate the
turtle, together with a strong desire to explore beyond what she alrady
knew, to find new ways of using the computer.  When she was being shown
how to use forward and turn commands, Holly was asking how to leave
spaces in a drawing (I showed her PENUP and PENDOWN, which she used
immediately).  As soon as she began drawing with the turtle she asked
about how to make curved lines.  She quickly got into spinning designs,
with reversing spins, and with finding the largest input she could to a
SPIN command.

Holly's very first turtle drawing exploration led to a project taking
three class periods to complete -- her unique "smily face."  (Figure H-1)
.block 23
.figure 21
.ce
Figure H-1: SMILY

As Holly worked on this project, her approach was to explore each part
of the figure, writing down the correct steps -- then make each part a
procedure.  The greatest difficulty was in making the mouth.  Although
Holly had a very good sense of what she wanted to do, and a plan drawn
on paper, she had a lot of difficulty figuring out how to make the
mouth symmetrical.  She worked by a process of trial and error, and did
not do any calculations as she worked.  Once she finished the mouth,
she did use an approach involving symmetry to make the "SMILE", the
upper part of the mouth.
.block 18
.figure 16
.ce
Figure H-2: MOUTH and SMILE

It seemed that she developed a sense of how she could make use of the
numbers she had already used, in completing her project, while
continuing to work in an exploratory mode.

.epage 1
By the time she completed this project, Holly had mastered the use of
90, 30 and 180 degrees, had learned how to use symmetry, had
mastered the basic idea of procedures, sub and super-procedures, and
had a good understanding of how to use error messages for debugging.

Holly's next project in turtle geometry arose out of some explorations
she was doing with SPIN commands.  Combining SPINs with forwards and
circles, she got the idea of making a cowboy, twirling a rope.  I
suggested that this would make a nice, although difficult project.
Holly made the cowboy quite nicely, and then decided to put a hat on
his head.  Since the turtle was spinning at the end of a loop, I had to
show her how to reverse the steps of SPINs, turns and forwards, to get
the turtle back to where it started, so that she could add the hat.
Holly needed help with debugging turtle state problems several times
during this project.  I introduced her to the idea of "playing
computer" -- working out the bugs by going through a procedure step by
step.  I also encouraged her to number her steps by fives, and to use
subprocedures.  She did not choose to use subprocedures for the COWBOY,
but did ultimately use subprocedures to draw and locate the HAT.
(Figure H-4)

.epage 1
The rest of Holly's turtle geometry work consisted of small projects:
some spinning designs, an oval, a clock, and a TICTACTOE "board" that
turned into her next major projects.  In working on her TICTACTOE
board, Holly made use of the same kind of exploratory approach --
combined with a lack of overall analysis -- that she used in her SMILY
project.  Her final drawing of a TICTACTOE board, made use of
horizontal, but not vertical symmetry, and had uneven spacing.  It
seems clear from analysis of her dribble file, Holly's idea of what a
TICTACTOE board looks like:  two lines crossing two other lines at
right angles.  She did not have the idea of the board consisting of
"nine squares", which would have led to a symmetrical drawing, and
simplified her trial and error work, in making the procedure.
Similarly, in making her "X", for use in the TICTACTOE goame, Holly
worked by a process of trial and error, to get a somewhat asymmetrical
X, rather than an analytical approach.

In making her X, Holly did make use of 30, 60 and 90 degree angles,
eventually combining them into 120 degree angles, which she used at
both top corners of the X.

1III - Holly's Work on Major Interactive Projects
.br
TicTacToe and Madlib0
.br
The TicTacToe project lasted for seven class sessions.  Holly had
expressed a sense of boredom with turtle geometry, and a curiosity
about what else the computer could do.  When she used the turtle to
draw a tictactoe board, I suggested that she develop this idea further,
making a game which could be played by two people, in which the
computer would draw the game, and keep track of the score.  A
possibility of making the computer one of the players was put off until
later.

In order to carry out this project, Holly had to learn a number of new
ideas about LOGO:
.nofill
.indent 6
the use of TYPE and PRINT commands
the use of MAKE to name points and variables
the use of REQUEST to get inputs from the players
the use of SETT to place the turtle at the right spot to 
	draw an X or 0
the use of IF and =, to determine where the next move should go; as
	well as the status of the game
the use of lists to keep track of moves and of winning combinations
the use of SENTENCE to add new elements to a list
setting up a data structure to keep track of the game
functional names for subprocedures
.indent 0
.adjust
Since I knew that it would be difficult for Holly to absorb all this
new material, I adopted an approach of suggesting things to her in
smallish doses, as she expressed a need for them.  We would talk
through the procedure first, as I tried to elicit as much description
from her as possible, of what she wanted the computer to do.  After
talking an idea through verbally, I would show her how to translate it
into LOGO.  Together we would establish the pattern that should be
followed, writing down the steps and sequences in Holly's notebook.
Holly then would copy them with careful attention to detail.

Holly Functioned extremely well in this mode.  Although she did not
fully understandn what she was doing, she felt confident that she could
get the bugs worked out.  Although this project required a lot of
typing, Holly was an excellent typist, and made few typing errors.
When she did need to correct, revise or add to a line, she easily
learned to use EDL and CTRL-N, as editing aids.

The problems occured when Holly began to make the program intelligent
enough to keep track of moves qnd record a win by either player, or a
tie.  Here she ran into difficulty because she was a bit confused about
the overall structure of her programs -- not always sure where a
particular subprocedure should be put -- into PLAY1 and PLAY2, her key
subprocedures, or into a sub-sub-procedure.  In such a case, "playing
computer" was again needed, and Holly was not able to resolve these
bugs without help.  Once the bugs were found, however, Holly seemed to
understand what had caused the bug, and why it had been fixed.

One example of this type of problem should suffice.  Near the end of
the project, Holly had completed her game to the point where it would
announce a winner, draw a line through the three Xs or 0s, and stop.
If the game was a tie, however, the computer would just keep playing,
asking for additional moves.  I asked Holly how she thought the
computer could keep track of whether the game was a tie.  After some
thought, she suggested having the computer count the number of moves.
If the total number of moves is nine, the computer declares the game a
tie, and stops.

.epage 2
In implementing this idea, I reminded Holly of how to initialize the
variable "COUNT, by using MAKE "COUNT 0, and how to increase it by
using MAKE "COUNT :COUNT+1.  The problem was, where to put these
instructions, and the final game ending instruction, IF :COUNT = 9
STOPLEVEL.  By talking it through, we realized that the initialization
of "COUNT should go into the superprocedure, TICTACTOE, and that the
increases should go into the PLAY1 and PLAY2 procedures.  Holly also
realized that the ending condition only needed to be put into PLAY1,
because the value of "COUNT could only be 9 during the first player's
turn. 

What Holly forgot, was to put the line MAKE "COUNT :COUNT+1, into PLAY2
as well as PLAY1.  Thus the count condition did not work.  Holly could
not debug this by herself.  I showed her how to PR :COUNT (which
printed 5), indicating that only the odd moves had been counted.  Then
we printed out PLAY2, and Holly realized that MAKE "COUNT :COUNT+1 was
missing.  She added it at the appropriate place with no difficulty.

 .  .  .  .  .  .  .

MADLIB lasted for five class sessions. After completing her TICTACTOE
project, Holly was at a loss for what to do nexct.  I suggested a
choice of six different projects.  The idea of doing a "madlib" story
was the most appealing of the six.  The basic idea is simple.  The
computer prints out a simple story, substituting randomly chosen nouns,
verbs, adjectives, etc., for specific words in the story.  This project
offered many fewer "new learnings", for Holly, and so was one that she
could readily manage on her own.  The new ideas she had to learn were these:

.nofill
.indent 6
procedures with outputs
the use of RANDOM to choose a number which would determine
	the particular word to be OUTPUT from a preset list
the use of % to create spaces in TYPEd output
the distinction between TYPE and PRINT

.indent 0 
.adjust
Once I showed Holly the syntax for using RANDOM and OUTPUT, she was
able to carry through the project almost entirely on her own.  The
structure of the project was much simpler than that of the TICTACTOE
project, so that when bugs occured, Holly could usually fix them
herself.  She had a little difficulty understanding that she had to
provide an output for each number, 0 through 9, output by RANDOM.  In
some of her procedures she listed 10 rather than 0, and would sometimes
get a confusing "NOUN DIDN'T OUTPUT AT LEVEL 1 LINE -- in MADLIB."
This message was confusing to Holly because it occurred very seldom
(approximately once out of every ten tries).
NOUN appeared to work perfectly some of the time and not work at all at
other times.  As we debugged each one of her subprocedures Holly
gradually came to understand the cause of this occasional problem.

Another more straightforward bug in the MADLIB procedure involved the
length of each statement involving a PRINT or TYPE command.  Since the
randomly chosen words had varying lengths, the typed lines would
sometimes run over the edge of the page, causing a word to be split
between two lines (see figure H-6)  Holly began the process of
eliminating these over-runs by adjusting the length of each line.  Of
course, shortening the first line made the second longer, so that the
process had to be repeated for each succeeding line.  Holly had not
completed this when the series of classes ended.

1IV - Holly's Interactions with Other Students
.br
0Holly seemed to have several kinds of interactions with other
students during the course of the LOGO classes.  With Tammy, Holly
developed a very protective, helping relationship, based on a growing
respect for Tammy's originality, outspokenness and sense of humor.
With David, Holly maintained a friendly teasing relationship, with a
strong component of competitiveness which became most clear when Holly
and David played DYNATURTLE games together in classes 20 and 21.  With
Larissa, a girl in another class, Holly was directly competitive --
Holly was quite upset when Larissa started on a tictactoe project
shortly after Holly did.  When Holly chose a new project, she carefully
avoided choosing one that was a "conversational" procedure, similar to
Larissa's "SHRINK".  In Holly's reaction to Larissa's work, it was
clear that Holly palced a great deal of importance on originality and
uniqueness in her work.  lShe was not content that the work be
independently and creatively carried out herself -- she also wanted to
be sure than noone else was doing work that might be directly compared
with hers.

During the course of the LOGO classes, Holly developed a special
relationship with Tammy.  When the classes started, Holly had a rather
minimal tolerance for Tammy.  During the classes, Tammy would often ask
Holly for help -- usually with spelling a word, sometimes with matters
relating directly to using the computer.  Holly spent most of class 7
helping Tammy with her work.  Tammy was trying to use the SPIN command
to spin some designs she had already made.

Holly showed her how to use the SPIN command before drawing the
picture, and showed her how to make the design spin faster by clearing
the screen, using a larger input for the SPIN command, and repeating the
drawing.  Later in the period, Holly helped Tammy type a procedure.
Tammy had been having difficulty copying a procedure from her notebook.
Holly dictated the steps to her one at a time, so that she could type
each one and check it before going on.  In helping Tammy, Holly showed
an unusual degree of sensitivity to what Tammy really needed to know,
and was able to explain things to her in simple direct terms which
Tammy easily understood.

Another way that Tammy and Holly related was through a sort of
"teasing" relationship that both girls seemed to enjoy.  This
culminated in a computer story that Tammy wrote called HOLLY.  Tammy
asked for information from Holly for the story, and Holly made it a
joke by supplying ludicrous names for the story.

By the end of the series of classes, Holly's English teacher reported
that Tammy had moved her seat in the classroom to be near Holly's, and
that Tammy was accepted by Holly and her circle of friends.
Previously, the teacher reported, Tammy had been isolated within the
classroom. 

1V -- Holly's Relationship With the Computer and With Computer Activities0
.br
At the outset of the LOGO classes, Holly was intrigued with the
computer, and curious about what it could do, and how to do it.  She
had less interest in actually carrying out computer activities.  She
became bored with Turtle Geometry rather quickly, despite (or perhaps
partly because of) the fact that using the turtle was fairly easy for
her.  She got interested in the idea of using a turtle drawing, to
play TicTactoe.  She started off on the tictactoe project with great
enthusiasm.  Although she followed through on the details with great
care and thoroughness, she became bored with the project once the
"creative" phase was over.  The same syndrome occurred during her
MadLib project.

Holly was one of the most competent of the children in our sample
groups at using the computer keyboard, understanding the computer's
possibilities, and at using diverse elements of the LOGO language
appropriately to achieve her purposes.  At the same time, her sense of
"creative involvement" was minimal.  The more creative her project, the
more tedius typing and debugging were required.  She did not enjoy the
process of finding and eliminating bugs, the way that Gary, a student
in one of the earlier classes did.

After her last class, I asked Holly whether she would like to work with
a computer again if she had a choice.  "Well," she reflected, "it would
depend on what the other choices were."
