1Tammy0

Tammy is a student who has great difficult with academic work in
school.  In mathematics and language she is considered to be several
years behind her classmates (her national achievement test scores place
her in the 2nd percentile).  Although she receives several hours of
special tutoring in the school's Learning Center, the staff feels that
she is not progressing rapidly enough, and are struggling to find an
appropriate educational program for her as she enters seventh grade.

From the beginning of her work in the LOGO classes, Tammy's work
provided an exception to most of the patterns we have observed among
the rest of the sixteen students in our study.  Although Tammy did very
little turtle geometry, she was more "involved" with the computer than
any other student.  She developed an almost "personal" relationship
with the computer she used, giving it a name, and treating it in the
way some chidren treat a doll or a pet.

Tammy's major use of the computer was as a typewriter and "editor".
Using a special program designed to allow her to use the printing
capability of the computer without writing procedures or using PRINT
commands, Tammy wrote a series of nine "stories", which she distributed
to her family, friends and teachers.  These stories constituted the
most significant work of Tammy's entire school year.

Tammy's success in writing and completing work with the computer has
led to success in other areas as well.  Tammy's assignments on a
regular basis -- something she had not been able to do before taking
the computer classes.  In addition, a friendship established with
Holly, another girl in her LOGO class, has led to Tammy's being
included socially with Holly and her friends in the classroom, ending
her previous isolation.

I.  Tammy's "Personal Relationship" with the Computer

Tammy had a very special relationship with one of the computers, which
she called "Peter".  While this was most noticeable in the earlier
classes, it persisted throughout Tammy's computer experience.  Her
attitude toward "Peter" was much like that often shown by children
toward a favorite pet or doll -- an exaggerated version of how one
might behave to a beloved younger child.

In the very first class, Tammy expressed an interest in communicating
with the computer:  "I thought it would talk to you, hello" When it
responded to a missing space in an FD445 command by printing "You
haven't told me how to FD445," Tammy responded with genuine anger:  "I
did, you fool!"  "Oh, this isn't doing what I told it to do," she said
at another point.

In the next class she again asked about communication:  "I want to ask
it questions.  Oh you know, What's your name?  Things like taht."  IN
response I explained that all the computer's answers would have to come
from her, ahd showed her how to use a PRINT command.  Her first
procedure gave the computer an answer to her first question:
.nofill

	2TO WHO
	1 PRINT [MY NAME IS PETER]
	END

.adjust
0Tammy was extremely possessive about the particular machine she
regularly used. She felt that this machine, her "Peter", was hers,
and she would say things like "Take good care of Peter,"  when she left
for the day.  lWhen she came late to class number four, "Peter" was
already being used by another student.  Tammy stormed and fussed. "I
want to use my computer.  That's the one I use very day."  When I
insisted they were all the same, Tammy responded; "I hate you...I think
I'm going to cry..." (to which Holly said "go right ahead, Tammy.")
Finally she was persuaded to use another coputer and was somewhat
reassured by the fact that it responded correctly to WHO, once she had
logged in.  She actually worked quite successfully, using the LETTER
procedure for the first time, to write a letter to her godmother,
Doris, signing it "Love Tammy and Peter."

In succeeding classes the other students all left "Tammy's computer" to
her, even when she came late -- except when they needed to use the printer.

As the classes went on, Tammy's "relationship" with Peter tempered
somewhat.  I continued to stress that the computer was a machine,
controlled by her, by me and by other programmers.  I pointed out that
I had written the program, LETTER, to help the computer help her write
stories, and that I wrote the message that she sometimes got from
the computer.

Gradually she reduced her expression of anger at the computer for error
messages, as she realized how the error messages were related to what
she had done.  Nonetheless, she continued to share credit for her
work with "Peter". "Do you want to see the stories me and Peter have
written?"  she would ask a visitor.  And she would often introduce
visitors to "Peter", using her WHO procedure.

I believe that Tammy progressed, by the end of the classes, to a more
balanced understanding of her role in relation to the computer.  By
this time, her behavior with the computer was much more matter-of-fact
and she had begun to interact very extensively with the other children
in the class.  As she came to understand the mechanical predictability
with which the computer responded to her, and as she began to take
pride in her accomplishments in story writing, "Peter" came more and
more to take on the status of a personal fantasy -- one which a child
knows is a fantasy, but persists in "playing" sometimes because
it's fun.

II. Tammy's way of working with the Computer

The strongest characteristic of Tammy's approach to working with the
computer was her need to clear the text display screen.  While many
children have a desire to clear the screen between projects, or when
bored or frustrated, Tammy exhibited this desire in an extreme way.
One of Tammy's first questions was about "how to get the words off the
screen," and learning how to accomplish this using the carriage return
was a major discovery of hers during the first class.  Once she figured
out how to do it she cleared the text display after almost every line
-- clearing it instantly after an error message without looking at the
message.  In later classes Tammy developed the habit of clearing the
text display before logging in, after logging in, after almost every
instruction that was not part of an ongoing task, and before and after
saying GOODBYE.

Tammy's habit of clearing the text display in this way interferred
significantly with her learning.  It effectively prevented her from
maintaining a continuity in what she was doing, and eliminated the
possibility of her responding to the computer's error messages.  Even
after completing a piece of work Tammy would hardly look at it:  after
I had finished helping her edit her first letter, DORIS, she swept it
off the screen without looking at the corrected version.

Tammy was able to leave several sequential lines on the screen, while
working on a specific project -- although it required a definite effort
on her part not to endulge her carriage return habit.  When working on
a drawing project, she would carefully copy all the necessary steps
into her notebook, then quickly clear the screen.

Tammy had a strong desire for completion and correctness in all her
work.  Although she might work for an hour steadily on a story, she
added to a "completed" story, however "unfinished" it might have
seemed.  Although she was quite a perfectionist by her own standards,
while working on a story, Tammy never proofread or edited a story once
she had declared it finished.  In fact, unless she noticed an error in
a particular line while typing it, or immediately after typing a
carriage return, she never went back to find an error.  Once a story
was done, it was done!  She might show it to other people, but she
rarely read it over to herself, and certainly not with a view to
analyze or correct it.  Incidents like the following were observed
several times.  lTammy was proofreading a sentence which began "ONCE
UPON TIME..."  but she read aloud, "Once upon a time..." and
continued, satisfied that her work was correct.

Tammy's attitude towards errors and towards completion of "correct"
work is also shown by her behavior in other situations.  One of her
learning disability tutors related that she would repeatedly throw out
whole pages once she had made one error -- a tactic that frustrated her
in working with a standard typewriter.  Hence in her written work she
had developed a style of writing only short pieces of one or two
"perfect" sentences.

Tammy also had a great desire for neatness in the classroom.  She took
it upon herself to collect and put away pens, notebooks, and other
items which had been left out by the children.  She would also remind
others regularly to put their things away.

In her pre-LOGO interview, Tammy showed the same kind of strategy, when
trying to arrange a series of permutations of a set of colored blocks.
The task was to create as many different arrangements of the blocks as
possible.  After having done a few, Tammy swept the old ones away,
clearing the table -- thus making it impossible for her to know whether
the next one was different or not.  When the interviewer re-established
all Tammy's old arrangements, she made one more, and then compulsively
swept them all away again.

In her work with the computer, Tammy quickly established a set of
conditions about what she could and couldn't do, and adhered to these
with little change through the classes.  Tammy could do the
folowing:  LOGIN "TAMMY; LET LETTER (to get her letter writing
procedure); start, write and end a letter; run a letter or a drawing
procedure by typing its name; and type the word GOODBYE.  Things she
couldn't or wouldn't do on her own included:  writing a procedure;
editing a procedure or a story; saving a procedure, by writing a file;
reading a file; and using the lineprinter.  These things, part of her
daily routine, wre done for her by me.

Since I wanted Tammy's work with the computer to be simple and
straightforward, with as few stumbling blocks as possible, I fell into
the habit of doing some of these things for Tammy, thinking that she
would gradually take over some of the functions as her work continued.
I found that it was very important for Tammy to keep the boundary
between what she would and wouldn't do, very firm.  Towards the end of
the classes, I made an effort to get her to use the lineprinter on her
own, showing her the PRINTON command, and showing her how to make
multiple copies of a story by using REPEAT.  Tammy objected to this
strongly, but agreed to do some of it, if I would share the work
with her.  I think that she would have eventually learned these
commands, and have attained a greater measure of independence in her
computer use.

Tammy did develop one way of editing stories.  If she made a mistake
early in a story she could start again by typing END, and clearing the
screen.  Typing LET LETTER again would clear out her workspace and
allow her to begin her story again.  Interestingly, when she did this,
she almost always typed an identical sentence to the one she had typed
before -- without any printed reference -- sometimes complete with the
error that had forced her to start over in the first place.  In such
cases she would stop and go through the whole process again until she
got it right.

Another characteristic of Tammy's working style was that she took a
long time to settle down to productive work.  She usually came to class
later than the other students, and wandered around a bit before
deciding what to do.  Once started on a story, she often made a lot of
mistakes on the first line -- requiring her to start the whole story
over again.  Once past the first line, however, she typ8ically finished
a story without any more false starts.  Her problem with starting was
reflected in a rush at the end of the class.  Since Tammy placed a
premium on completed work, she often found it necessary to stay after
class to finish up.

III. Tammy and the Turtle

Tammy used the turtle in only nine of the four class sessions.  Most of
her use of the turtle required active help from me or one of the other
students.

From the beginning, Tammy had great difficulty concentrating on what
the turtle was doing in response to the commands she typed.  In the
very first class Tammy literally "dozed off" while the rest of the
class was figuring out how to draw a box, and how to write a procedure.
When she began to work on her own, she tended to work randomly,
copying commands from an instruction sheet without looking at their
effect, and clearing the actual commands from the text display almost
as quickly as she typed them.  For numerical inputs she chose double
numbers like 55, sequences like 34, or combinations like 445.  At the
end of the period she did write a few steps and a comment in her notebook:

.block 7

?B.D. 23	right and forward
?F.D. 23

.adjust
0Although Tammy seemed to have difficulty throughout the first class in
focussing on what the turtle was doing in response to her typing,
she did notice when the command HT 78 made the turtle disappar, and
asked for help saying "I want my turtle back."  She had a mch stronger
response to the computer's text responses -- angrily commenting about
error messages and sweeping them off the screen with a stream of
carriage returns.

In the second class she was more thoughtful about what she was doing,
eventually recognizing that she had caused the computer to draw a
"seven", and carefully copying down the steps in her notebook:

.nofill

in her notebook:

.block 16
.sp 12

Figure T-4

This could be the beginning of a "house".  Tammy returned to a similar
shape in class #13.

In class six, Tammy decided in advance what she wanted the computer to
draw:  a "zero".  When I asked her to draw a zero by hand, she drew it
as a rectangle, indicating that she understood that it was easier for
the turtle to draw straight lines than to draw curves.  In building her
rectangle with the turtle she first tried FD 34, decided that was too
small; swithced to FD 66 which was still too small; but then added
on a step, FD 45, to complete the vertical side of the rectangle.  At
the corner, she was not sure what to do.  She knew she wanted to turn
right, but didn't know how much.  When I asked her to guess she
suggested RT 8 or RT 9, or maybe RT 34.  I decided to give her the
correct turn, RT 90, saying that it was the same for all four corners,
because I wanted Tammy to be successful in her fist planned drawing.
(Actually, I offered her the choices of experimenting for herself,
or obtaining the angle from me.  She chose the latter.)  At the top of
her rectangle, she first tried FD 23, then added FD 45.  She knew how
big she wanted it to be, but had no clear idea of which numbers to use
to get there.  Once she turned the upper right hand corner, she tried
to use the PD (PENDOWN) command to finish the far side of the
rectangle.  I explained the function of PD and reminded her to use FD,
and the same numbers she had used before (66 and 45) to complete the
side.  She was then able to complete the lower side of the rectangle by
herself, and gave a cheer when it was finished.  She decided to call it
"TAMMY" and carefully copied the steps in her notebook.  She put off
teaching it to the computer until next time.

IN class 12 Tammy taught her procedure TAMMY to the computer.  She had
some trouble copying the steps.  When she typed 66 as a line number
instead of 6, Tammy insisted on tredoing the whole thing, instad of
editing.  When the same thing happened again, Tammy let me fix it, by
erasing the line for her.

0Once Tammy finished teaching the procedure, TAMMY, I suggested that she
repeat it, asking her where she thought it would be drawn the second
time.  While she had difficulty predicting hwere the second rectangle
would appear, she had a pretty good idea whre the third and fourth
would go.  Although she like this design, (fig, T-6) she did not want
to teach it to the computer.

.block 20

Tammy then asked Holly to show her how to make it spin, using the SPON
command.  Tammy did this several times, with spinds of 100 and 1000.
She also asked for help in making the same design spin when she came to
class next time (class 8).

This was Tammy's last attempt to draw anything until class thirteen, in
which I introduced her to a "DRAW" procedure which automatically made a
procedure out of any turtle commands that she used.  I gave her a great
deal of encouragement, as she produced a design that looked a little
like the beginning of a "house".  She stopped it at the point shown,
when the DRAW procedure ran out of storage space.  Tammy called the
procedure "DAN" in my honor, but once she had completed drawing it, she
had no interest in looking at it again, and never did.  I did not
suggest that Tammy draw a picture again.

One other exposure to using the turtle came when Tammy had a visit from
Dianne in class ten.  Once Tammy had shown Dianne her stories, Dianne
showed Tammy how to draw a pair of "eyes" using RARCs and LARCs.
Although Tammy wrote the steps down in her notebook, she never tried
them out on her own.

0I might conjecture that if Tammy had not had the possibility of using
the computer to write stories, she might have persevered with drawing a
lot more.  Tammy's experience with the "zero" drawing shows that she
was capable of seeing the connection between the commands she was
giving and what the turtle was drawing.  On the other hand, Tammy was
delighted with using the computer to write stories.  This was a unique
and special use of the computer, and she did not have to compare her
work with anyone else's.   Drawing with the computer may have seemed to
be just another activity at which she was "not as good" as her classmates.

IV. Tammy's Stories

Most of Tammy's time and effort in using the computer was devoted to
writing.  A special program, LETTER was created for her use, allowing
her to type a story directly into the computer with having to write a
procedure, using line numbers or PRINT commands.  Tammy used the LETTER
procedure to write two "letters" and seven "stories" over a period
spanning twenty classes.  She also started at least three more stories
that were discarded before she finished them.

In her stories, Tammy had a "product" of which she could be proud.  She
could easily share copies with her classmates, teachers and family and
with visitors to the LOGO classes.  It was a unique product -- not to
be compared with the work of other students -- which was very important
to Tammy, who was used to having her work evaluated as being of lower
quality than that of her fellow students.  Most importantly, Tammy was
able to use the computer to express her ideas in writing and to improve
her writing skills in a way that she had not been able to do in regular
classes or in her special tutorial programs.

Here are Tammy's nine "stories" (as she called them), beginning with
DORIS (class 4) and continuing to MISS.HIRSH (class 21).  They show
considerable development in style, sophistication and in proficiency in
grammar and punctuation.  They are presented here exactly as Tammy
wrote them.

0Tammy's first two stories, DORIS and HELEN, are really letters, written
to her godmother and mother respectively.  The next four were all "made
up stories about real people."  Tommy, Ann, Sonny and Donell are all
Tammy's relatives.  Sonny and Donell are Tammy's brothers.  The last
three stories, HOLLY< MR.LEWIS and MISS.HIRSH are about a classmate,
and about Tammy's regular sixth grade teachers.

Beginning with the very first class, Tammy had shown an interest in
"communicating" with the computer, and in using the computer as a
typewriter.  In the second and third classes I showed Tammy how to
write procedures using the PRINT command, first with brackets, then
with a variable input.  Her typing difficulties made it hard for her to
be successful using the PRINT command.

I created a special program for Tammy called LETTER, which allowed her
to choose a name for a letter, then type whatever she wants to write
directly into the computer.  The LETTER procedure interprets each of
Tammy's typed lines as a separate "REQUEST" and automatically makes a
procedure to print out her lines in order.  If Tammy wants to change a
line she can use the rubout key, before she types a carriage
return.  Other than that, it has no special editing capability.  When
Tammy finishes with a story, she types END, which causes the LETTER
procedure to finish defining the procedure.  It then types, out "HERE
IS YOU RLETTER, DORIS" (for example), and runs the procedure, printing
the lettter exactly as Tammy types it.  

Tammy was quickly able to use the LETTER procedure on her own to write
whatever she wanted.  She would type LET LETTER, choose a name for her
story, and begin (LET is a procedure which reads her lettter writing
procedures into her workshopace), she had problems if she wanted to
change a line after typing a carriage return (in which case I had
to help her edit her procedure after it was all finished), or when she
typed a series of carriage returns to clear the text display.
Sometimes she accidentally typed carriage return intending to type a
rubout.  After typing a string of carriage returns, she would often
type END and start all over.  Tammy was never able to edit a procedure
on her own.

Tammy was introduced to LETTER in class four -- the same class in which
she made such a fuss about having to use a "different" computer.  She
wrote the letter DORIS (fig. t-9), writing it out first by hand, and
copying it on the computer.   At the end of the class I printed out
several copies for her, as she carefully estimated how many she would
need:  "One for me, one for my mother, one for Doris (her godmother),"
etc.  In her notebook, Tammy wrote. "Today me and Peter did a letter".

Tammy's letter seems to follow a set "letter writing format."  The only
punctuation Tammy used was a period after the first question.  Tammy
carefully proofread the letter, and I changed it from "HOW YOU DOING UP
NEW YORK." to "HOW ARE YOU DOING UP IN NEW YORK." at Tammy's direction.

Tammy's next letter was HELEN, written during class six.  This letter,
accomplished in a much shorter time, was written to her mother.  It
followed the same format:  greeting, question, statement, signature.
Puncutation consisted of two periods.  Tammy accidently pushed the
carriage return before correctly spelling the final word, "MONEY," so I
helped her edit the letter, and helped her with spelling as well.

0In class eight, Tammy asked if she could use LETTER to write a "story".
When I responded affirmatively, she began to write a story which she
called TOMMY.  She had several false starts before settling down to
complete a seven line story, which ends rather abruptly (fig. T-11).
She had trouble typing the first line and used the carriage return a
lot between lines, which messed up her story.  I helped her twice to
erase it and start again.  Once she completed the first line
successfully, she went on to write seven lines, before deciding she was
finished.

The story TOMMY represented a big change from Tammy's previous computer
writing, and set the tone for the rest of the writing she was to do.
IN Tommy, her concern was not for a grammatically correct carful
statement following a prearranged format.  Rather she was concerned
with the details of the story:  the names of the characters, the places
they lived, the sequence and timing of events.  The only plunctuation
was one period after LIZ, and two apostrophes (typed in very
deliberately in places where Tammy should have had an "s").  Tammy had
a lot of trouble typing the apostrophes, as she had to use the shift
key.  I reminded her not to type carriage return until she was
satisfied with the whole line, and she often rubbed out all or most of
a line to correct a spacing or spelling error.  Once a line was
finished, however, she did not ask me to correct anything.

abruptly (fig. T-12).  IN this case, time ran out before she completed
it, and Tammy considered it finished as it stood.  She showed no
interest in adding to it at a later class.  Tammy got started on her
story right away, without any false starts.  She did push the carriage
return while there was still an error on the first line, but this time,
she asked for help, and I told her I'd  help her fix it when the whole
story was finished.  She worked very carefully on her firt seven
sentences, rubbing out and rewriting as often as necessary, carefully
checking each sentence before going on.  She finally got frustrated in
starting the eight line, typed a lot of carriage returns and called for
help.  I helped her edit, correcting the mistakes she pointed out, and
eliminating the extra lines.  lAt this point, Tammy declared the story
finished, and printed out about 10 copies, offering them to classmates
as well as to two visitors.  She appeared to have a great deal of pride
in her work.

0Tammy's next story, SONNY (fig. T-13) was written during class 14.
Although Tammy had a lot of difficulty getting the first line the way
she wanted it, and had to restart several times, she wrote a nine line
story -- her longest to date -- without asking for any further
corrections.  Tammy used several periods throughout the story.  In each
case she checked with me to see if the period was located correctly.
At one point Tammy asked whether she should use "adopt" or "adopted".
I explained the difference in meaning by using each in a sentence.  It
was clear to me that Tammyh could not hear the difference in the
way the words sounded, so that the choice was completely arbitrary
to her.  She decided to use "adopt" at that point, and throughout the
rest of the story.

In this case, Tammy was less interested in the details of the story
than in the "moral" -- how glad she was that she was not adopted, and
that every kid should be grateful to their parents.  Tammy was clearly
using SONNY to express some very deep feelings and values -- as well as
some appreciation for her own parents.

0After Tammy had completed SONNY, I asked her if I could see some
samples of the writing she was doing in class.  "I don't have time to
write stories in class," was her reply.  "I've got too much work to
do."  I then asked Tammy's English teacher and her learning
disabilities teacher for samples of Tammy's writing.  They both
confirmed the fact that Tammy had done virtually no creative writing
this year.  Her English teacher explained that Tammy rarely completed
any work -- pointing out that Tammy's computer stories were among
her first finished pieces of work.

Tammy's next story, DONELL (Fig. T-14) was written during class
fifteen.  Once again, Tammy had difficulty settling down to start her
story, and ran out of time before finishing it.  I suggested that Tammy
finish it next time.  She agreed, but never came back to it.

0Donall seemed to have the making of a real story with a definite plot
line, and realistic dialogue.  It is clearly "unfinshed" despite the
fact that Tammy typed "THE END" on the last line.  During the course of
her work, Tammy asked me whether $200 was a lot of money for rent.  I
said that it depended on whether it was $200/month or $200/week.  I
said that I thought that $200/month was a reasonable rent, while
$200/week was very high.  Tammy wrote that the rent was $200 a week.

Tammy came into the next class (number sixteen) in a loud, rather
boisterous mood, and was quite impatient with my plan for the day,
which involved a group discussion of the story, "ZEEP and the Paint."
After fussing and joking all through the story and discussion, Tammy
began to write a story "about HOLLY," (fig. T-15) another girl in the
class.  This gave her the chance to make all kinds of jokes, to yell
out questions about Holly (which Holly answered with more jokes --
giving "EGGBERT" and "ABIGAIL" as her parents' names), and continuing
to make a nuiscence of herself.  She ended with a reference to Holly
"going with a boy name David Kleiler for 3 months".  that put the whole
class in an uproar and resulted in a general chase.  In the turmoil,
neither David or Holly could get any of their own work done, paying
more attention to Tammy than to anything else.  Although it was all
carried out in a spirit of lighthearted folling, Tammy effectively
disrupted the class, despite numerous requests to calm down, which
Tammy blithly disregarded.

Despite this, her story, HOLLY, was well constructed and carefully
written.  She paid careful attention to spelling and punctuation --
asking for assurances on the placing of periods at the ends of
sentences.

0Tammy came to class 20 with Deborah again.  I suggested that they work
together on a story.  Their way of working together was for Tammy to
dictate the story, while Deborah typed it for her.  The resulting
story, MR. LEWIS (Fig. T-16) was Tammy's longest, clearest, and had a
more direct flow than had been usual in Tammy's stories.  Deborah typed
the story exactly as Tammy dictated -- Tammy dictated the puncutation
as well.  Tammy's verbal dictation seems to have been closer to
standard english grammar than her own typing.  The story has a clear
plot, with a definite beginning and ending.  Tammy ended the story by
writing "BY TAMMY DEBORAH AND PETER," after thinking for a few minutes
about how to share the credit.  After finishing, Tammy had two
corrections she wanted to make.  I did the editing by printing out the
story and having her indicate corrections on the printed copy.

0Tammy's last story, MISS.HIRSH (Fig. T-17) was written in only 20
minutes.  She managed to type it without any significant errors or
false starts.  She was particularlly concerned about the location of
periods, and the use of apostrophes in DIDN'T and HAVEN'T.  (She knew
where the apostropes went, but wanted to have that confirmed by me.)
I'm not sure what Tammy is trying to say in this story.  It is
significant that the "nasty old 42 year old woman" (described in the
story as Lisa's mother) is given the name HELEN.  Helen is the name
of Tammy's mother.  After finishing the story, Tammy turned to me with
a gleam in her eye and said "Mis Hirsh can take a joke."

0Tammy spent class twenty-two printing out 12 cpies of each of her
stories.  I suggested that she make a procedure to print them all out
on one sheet of paper -- but Tammy said that she preferred to have
twelve copies of each story.  After the stories were printed, she
carefully cut them all apart (with the assistance of an adult visitor)
and made up little piles, each of which contained nine different
stories. 

In class twenty-five, Tammy finally accepted my suggestions that she
make a procedure to rpint out all her stories on one piece of paper.  I
did all the typing for the procedure, FOXYLADY, and inserted the story
titles and spacing.  Tammy told me the order in which she wanted the
stories:  SONNY, DONELL, DORIS, HELEN, ANN, HOLLY, MR.LEWIS,
MISS.HIRSH, and TOMMY.

I have tried to speculate about the reasons why Tammy was able to
accomplish so much in the area of writing in the LOGO classes, while
she has been unable to accomplish much writing in either her regular
classes or with her language tutors.  After consulting with her
teachers, I think I have some insights about how this came about.

Tammy is a fanatic about complete work without errors.  When an error
occurs in Tammy's normal work, she tears up the paper and throws it
away.  Since she never examines her errors, or tries to learn from
them, errors are seen by her as a total disaster.  Using the computer,
she was able to rubout many errors as they occurred without destroying
all her work up to that point.  In this way she could be satisfied with
her finished product.  Once she declared herself "finished" she never
looked back to see if there were any other errors.

The nicely typed computer output had a "professional" quality that
looked more polished than anyone else's work.  In addition, she could
have as many copies as she wanted at no extra effort -- which could
bring her positive attention from friends, family, and several
different teachers, all in the same day.

In accordance with her abhorance of "errors", Tammy may feel extremely
sensitive to any "correction" of her work whether direct or implied.  I
offered no correctino or criticism of Tammy's work, and confined my
assistance to answering her questions about spelling and
punctuation.  In this case, Tammy knew that her work would not be
criticized.  Therefore, since it looked "correct", even outstanding,
and since Tammy had worked hard to get it "correct", Tammy assumed that
it was "correct, and was very proud of it.

Tammy felt that her work was unique among the kids in the computer
classes.  Just as only Tammy could use the computer she called "PTER",
only Tammy could use the LETTER procedure to write stories.  Thus Tammy
could feel that her work was at least as good as the other students'
work.  Tammy rearely has had the opportunity to feel taht way about her
work.

In a meeting held after the end of computer classes, Tammy's English
teacher said that Tammy has recently been making a significant effort
to complete assignments and turn in work.  She said that Tammy's
computer stories were the first completed work that Tammy had given her
this year.

V. Tammy's Social Behavior with Adults and Children

Just as Tammy's "relationship" with the computer was of the utmost
importance to her, she also palced a high premium on her personal
relationships with the people around her.  At first Tammy seemed to
have a great deal of sensitivity about being "watched" by adults in the
classroom which relaxed a bit as the classes went on.  She was
particularly concerned about observers who took notes, and she would
occassionally ask them what they were writing about.  Tammy made a
point of introducing herself to all the visitors who came at different
times to observe the classes, and of establishing a definite
relationship with any who came more than once.

At times, Tammy could be quite manipulative -- especially when she
wanted help.  She could be loud and insistent calling across the room
for assistance, and a few minutes later rebuke another child for
"interrupting".  She often corrected other people's behavior, saying
that some action, or omission was "rude", or "sloppy".  This was
usually done in a somewhat cherrful, "motherly" tone that had only a
slight undercurrent of hostility.

Tammy insisted that she be noticed.  When she came to class late, she
would often be singing or shouting loudly in an impressively powerful
voice, as she walked in the door.  If a visitor was present, she would
quite down suddenly in embarrassment. Throughout the class period she
would call loudly across the room to a teacher, visitor or a classmate.

In her relations with her classmates, Tammy adopted a "breezy,"
somewhat teasing style, characterized by a cheerful good humor.
Occasionally this "breeziness" got out of control, and became
disruptive and rowdy, including chases around the room, hitting and
hair-pulling.  At such times, Tammy had a very difficult time settling
back into appropriate class behavior.

At other times -- especially with visitors present -- Tammy would be
extremely quitet, polite and demure.  It was as if she had two sets of
rules -- one for serious behavior in public -- the other for playful
behavior in private.  As the classes went on, it was clear that Tammy
considered the LOGO classroom as a "private" place, where she was among
friends and could be her playful self.

At first Tammy was "tolerated", somewhat sceptically by the other kids.
 Gradually, Holly and David got quite involved with her playfulness,
and cherrful bantring.  Most of the time they seemed to enjoy the
distraction she provided, and allowed her to provide an excuse for
letting their own playfulness emerge on occasion.  A>J> remained aloof.

Holly became quite "protective" of Tammy, sticking up for her on
occasion, as well as helping her with her work from time to time.
Tammy gradually came to consult Holy frequently about spelling and
punctuation.  Holly spent a lot of one class period helping Tammy type
a turtle procedure, and showing her how to use the SPIN command.

Tammy took a lot of interest in Holly and David as a "couple", teasing
them regularly about their friendship.  She wrote their "relationship"
into her story, HOLLY, and spent a good deal of one class period
watching them play dynaturtle games together -- commenting regularly,
not on their dynaturtle strategies, but on their personal interchanges.

Holly's interest in Tammy was evidenced outside of LOGO classes as
well.  One of Tammy's classroom teachers reported that she had moved
her seat in class to be near Holly and her group of friends.  In
becoming accepted by them, she had moved from virtual "isolation into
the core of the class, socially."  Her teacher attributed this to the
relationship Tammy developed during the LOGO classes and to the feeling
of success she has had with her computer work.
