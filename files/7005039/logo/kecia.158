Individual Profiles; Kathy

From the very beginning of the classes, Kathy displayed a quiet confidence, and competance in using the computer.  Although not very assertive in the early group sessions, she seemed to have an excellent understanding of basics right from the start.

Kathy was extremely comfortable, with giving and receiving help.  She often helped other children with the use of disks, particular elements of the LOGO language, ideas for projects, etc.  She was also quite willing to ask for help when she needed it, both from the teacher and from classmates, especially Monica.  In this way, Kathy was able to make steady progress in her understanding of LOGO, in her ability to conceive and carry out projects and in problem solving skills.

Kathy enjoyed working with concepts, rather than simply with practical results. Kathy was the only student among the first eight to persevere in making the computer draw a circle.  We spent a lot of time, talking and playing turtle, until Kathy understood that she could make a circle by repeating FD 20, RT 20, over and over again.  She rejected the idea of accomplishing this with recursion (although it would have been quicker), because (I believe) she was trying to follow through with her own idea of repeating each step, step by step.  She did accept the idea of combining several of the steps into a subprocedure, and then repeating the subprocedure to make a circle.  When her final result, SHELL, eventually had too many steps, and went on past the closing point of the circle, she was satisfied with it.  She knew that she could have modified her circle to make it close exactly.  What she had been concerned with was whether the circle would close at all.  When it did, she was satisfied that she had solved her problem.

This is typical of Kathy's approach.  She developed a concept of what she wanted to do.  She asked for help when she felt she needed it.  She listened to the various suggestions, and selected from them the ones she wanted to follow, in accordance with her own understanding of what the problem was about.  Whatever approaches she used in her problem solving, she learned.  While she often asked for help, she did not need to ask for help in those areas again.

Kathy was comfortable initating ideas for projects, and borrowing them from others -- even copying procedures directly from a booklet or bulletin board.  She quickly learned that direct copying often led to unexpected problems, and she became more careful with her borrowing.

Kathy and Monica worked together a great deal (See notes about Monica)  Both of them were interested in small, short-term projects, with visually pleasing results.  Both depended on their mutual sharing as a source of ideas, help and reassurance.  Although they often worked on the same tasks, they usually worked separately.  Their approaches, and results, were different.  Kathy's favorite activity was making a procedure and repeating it.  Monica's was repeating a procedure and putting a rotation after each repeat. For example, Kathy borrowed a procedure of Marilyn's called HORSE in which the computer repeated the instructions, BOX, RT 20, five times.  Kathy changed and elaborated it as follows:

.nofill

.block 10
TO HORSE
1 BOX
2 RT 70
3 BOX
4 RT 70
5 BOX
6 RT 70
7 BOX
8 RT 70
END
.indent 0

and she repeated it, using:

.indent 6
.block 7
TO BARN 
1 HORSE
2 HORSE
3 HORSE
4 HORSE
5 HORSE
END

.indent 0
.adjust
Kathy made BARN, after repeating HORSE several times by direct command and deciding that she wanted to repeat HORSE exactly 5 times.  Although she could have used recursion, she chose to limit her repeats to exactly five.  She also called her new procedure BARN, introducing the mnemonic device "a barn is a group of horses."  Once again, Kathy was "in charge" of what happened, using the cliche idea, "repeat a procedure over and over," but keeping control of both the process and the end result.  She chose not to use recursion -- I think because she wanted to retain control (figure Ka-1).

Thus when Kathy and Monica worked on similar tasks, each child brought her own specific knowledge, experience and "bag of tricks" to the project; and came out with a result that made her feel successful.  Looked at in detail, we see that the girls actually functioned quite differently, and what each of them learned from the project was probably quite different.  I don't think there was any great significance to the choice of angle (20 degrees for Monica and 70 degrees for Kathy).  Both were simply using a number that had worked out well before.  Kathy's 70 may have been just a mis-copying of Monica's 20.

If Kathy's work had an area of weakness, it was in Turtle Geometry.  Kathy had difficulty estimating angles right from the start, and tended to stay away from projects that made it necessary for her to work precisely with angle manipulations.  Although she and I "talked through" the idea that "when the turtle goes all the way around, it turns 360 degrees, as part of Kathy's circle project, this  became an idea that she "filed" away, and did not find much use for on her own.  Most of Kathy's projects involved circles and arcs, squares of different sizes, and one triangle procedure, which was one of the first ones she defined.  Her specialty became combining old procedures, and repeating them in various ways to make new designs.

Kathy's TRIANGLE was used together with her BOX to make a HOUSE, repeated four times made HOUSE4. TRIANGLE repeated twice made BUTTERFLY.  BUTTERFLY repeated 6 times made 7BUTTERFLY.  HOUSE4 combined with 7BUTTERFLY became HB47.  Later, circles were added to HB47, to make SPI. (figure Ka-2).

When Kathy repeated her borrowed XMASTREE procedure, she found that many repeats made a lovely, complex design.  Here she was willing to use recursion, since she was not concerned about how many times the procedure was repeated in all.  (figure Ka-3)

Later in the series of classes Kathy did a lot of experimentation with arcs and circles, and began to work on some longer projects.  They sometimes led to serious bugs which Kathy had to resolve.  One day she discovered that a series of arcs "looks" like a worm," and wrote the procedures WORM and WORMY (in which WORMY is exactly twice the size of WORM).  (figure Ka-4)

In a later experiment, which made use of symmetry in an unusual way, Kathy created an exotic looking "Monster."  (See Figure Ka-5).

.sp 18

Figure Ka-5

When she decided to teach MONSTER to the computer, I suggested that she break up the project into three parts.  She isolated three parts, and decided to name them MO, NS, and TER, so that her procedure MONSTER would be:

.block 6
.nofill
TO MONSTER
1 MO
2 NS
3TER
END

and the subprocedures were:

.block 8  
TO MO		TO NS		TO TER
1 RARC 40	1 LARC 40	1 RARC 40
2 RARC 20	2 LARC 20	2 RARC 20
3 LARC 40	3 RARC 40	3 LARC 40
4 LARC 20	4 RARC 20	4 LARC 20
5 LCIRCLE 20	5 RCIRCLE 20	5 RCIRCLE 20
6 RCIRCLE 20	6 LCIRCLE 20	6 LCIRCLE 20
END		END		END

.adjust
I am not sure whether Kathy realized that MO and TER were identical, but in any case, she needed TER as a distinct procedure to carry through her conceptual scheme.  

.block 18

Figure Ka-5

Kathy had forgotten to include the interface steps between the three procedures, so that when she ran MONSTER, the result (found in figure Ka-6) Kathy found quite dismaying.  She asked for help in debugging.  I suggested running MO, NS and TER separately.  When Kathy did so, she could see that the intermediate steps had been left out.  Together we worked out what these steps should be, and in its final incarnation, MONSTER became:

Kathy's last project, carried out during classes 21 and 22, also involved symmetrical arcs, and also required a good deal of debugging.  In this case, Kathy had tried out a long sequence of direct commands, and made a mistake or two in copying them into her notebook.  When her procedure turned out to be buggy, she had to spend a lot of time stepping through it, in order to figure out which steps were wrong, and how to fix them.  Since she had numbered all her steps by ones, she had to do a great deal of unnecessary retyping.  I had suggested to Kathy that she number steps by fives or tens, at several points in her work, but she had never felt a need to adopt that suggestion.  (In the class following this one, Kathy had a visitor, Renee, who was learning to write a procedure.  When Kathy taught her, she told her to number the steps by tens.  It seems that she got the point, however belatedly.)

One area of concern for me, during the classes was Kathy's lack of awareness of the effects of using different angles in various procedures.  I tried to deal with this by giving her a POLY :ANGLE procedure to experiment with.  While she like the designs that it made, she did not analyze the connection between the input number, and the shape that resulted.  In her first session experimenting with POLY, she used the following inputs: 88, 234, 12345, 300, 344, 90, 199, 125, and 888, 666, 555, and 77 (class 10).  Although she used POLY again on five other occasions, she continued to choose inputs fairly randomly.

Figure Ka-7

During class 20, she was experimenting with her procedure WOW which drew a set of nested squares.  She was trying to rotate this to create a particular design, (figure Ka-7) but could not figure out which angle to use to rotate WOW, despite several attempts.  I decided that this would be a good point for me to suggest a focus for her.  I showed her the procedure, 

.block 6
.indent 6
.nofill
TO SPINWOW :ANGLE
10 WOW
20 RT :ANGLE
30 IF HEADING = 0 STOP
40 SPINWOW :ANGLE
END

.indent 0
.adjust
This was meant to serve as a vehicle for exploring angles, and for furthering her understanding of variables and STOP rules.

At first she chose inputs like 900, 9999, 777 and 666.  At the beginning of the next class, I spoke to her about "interesting angles," reminding her that the turtle turns all the way around in 360 degrees.  I suggested that numbers that divided evenly into 360 degrees might be "interesting numbers".  I also suggested that she spend the period experimenting with SPINWOW, and taking notes on the results.

.epage 1
Initially Kathy took me at my word, and began using inputs that were factors of 360, like 4, 12, and 18, 60 and 90.  She quickly branched out to 100, 200, 400, etc.  Since she had been specifically asked to take notes on the results, she paid careful attention to what was happening, for the first time.  For example, she counted the number of "cones" that appeared in the designs, and this showed her that certain figures (SPINWOW 200  and SPINWOW 400) looked "the same".  Her notes, entitled "Interview with SPINWOW'S" are copied from her notebook (see figure Ka-8). (compare this with Monica's work with her procedure WISHWOW).

Kathy liked to initiate new projects, was comfortable with new ideas, and enjoyed the challenge of working on something to which the answer was not known in advance.  She accepted the existence of bugs - even coined the phrase "exterminating" to replace "debugging" -- and was willing to work to resolve them.  On the other hand, she usually chose to work on small projects, and to carefully limit the tools required for any task that she set herself.  This was her way of remaining in control of her work, making sure that her experience was not too confusing for her.

If Kathy had had the opportunity to continue with her classes, I'm sure that I would have continued to stress working on projects using angles as variables.  Also I would have tried to lead Kathy into at least one long term project that required advanced planning and the use of subprocedures.  More work in these areas would have nicely rounded out her LOGO experience.
