Individual Profiles; Monica

Monica started off in LOGO with a burst of enthusiasm and confidence.  She had a very good sense of turtle state, right from the beginning -- an intuitive sense of where a figure would be drawn, a good sense of how far to turn.  She was fascinated by the process of making a figure, rotating it, and repeating the process over and over.  She easily adopted the use of simple recursion to do this, and created many different simple projects of this type.

As the classes went on, Monica limited most of her work to this particular mode, and had a hard time getting beyond it.  Almost all her work was in the style of "figure, turn, figure, turn.." She learned to use variables, to make the figure turn different amounts, and had some exposure to stop rules, which she didn't quite master.  What Monica did not do was get into long term projects of any kind, or show much initiative in breaking out of the "mold" in which she had placed herself.

Monica had a very close relationship with Kathy, the other girl in her class.  (According to their teacher, they do not have a close relationship outside of the LOGO classroom.) The two girls often consulted together, borrowed ideas, worked on the same, or similar projects, and asked for and offered help to each other throughout the classes.  Their relationship was normally quite "mutual" with a lot of give and take, although leadership shifted back and forth.  On different occasions, observers who came for a one shot visit observed:  "teacher-student relation between Monica and Kathy.  Monica tells Kathy what to do and Kathy always goes to Monica to make sure she has done it right..." or, another time:  "Monica was at a loss as to what to do with herself... at last Kathy arrived. Kathy found a worksheet for her...(she) got upset, panicked and ran to Kathy for a new thing to do."  Another observer: "K and M work together very constructively -- each on top of things, making suggestions".  This last observation corresponds most closely to my sense of their overall relationship throughout.  (See notes on Kathy -- pages 3 and 4).

As the classes went on, Monica tended to have fewer ideas of what she wanted to do.  She would borrow ideas from Kathy, from the bulletin board, or from a booklet of projects, often copying carelessly, by rote, not thinking about what the steps were supposed to do.  Monica did not have much of an inclination to plan, to think ahead, or to debug her work.  If something didn't work out the way she wanted it to, she would often just forget about it, leaving a bunch of useless procedures in her file, along with the good ones.  Usually she did not ask for help.  Although she had been shown how to use ED to change procedures at an early point, she rarely chose to use it, until late in the series of classes.  Her procedures tended to be short and simple.  If they didn't do what she wanted, she'd forget them.  During the last few classes, Monica expressed an interest in debugging a rather lengthy procedure, her HAT procedure, that drew a Christmas tree, so that the stump would be "straight". She wanted to change it from:
.block 7
.ce
TO:
.sp 6

This was her first real interest in any procedures longer than a few lines that did not simply repeat a few fixed steps.

I spent about 20 minutes working with her on it, using STEP to isolate the lines that needed changing.  The following class was "visitors day", and Monica never got back to finish the project.

Monica's use of names was erratic.  Her "HAT" made a "Christmastree."  BOX, TRI, BUS, BUSWHEEL, BUSWHEEL2, HOUSE, HOUSE4, related to specific objects; HORSE, WOW, WISHWOW, BOODLE, HOTHOUSE, were fairly random.  She seemed to have difficulty choosing names, as she had difficulty chosing projects.

Monica kept thorough notes of her work by writing down every procedure in her notebook, either before or after trying it out.

During the first few classes, when the group of four children worked together, Monica demonstrated a good understanding of turtle state.  By considering where the turtle was, she was able to predict where the next procedure would occur.  This was especially useful, because the projects that the children were doing involved making designs with squares, using a BOX procedure.  In the sixth class, Monica and Kathy worked together, putting a BOX and a TRIANGLE together to make a HOUSE.  Monica had a very strong sense (much better than Kathy's) of how much to turn the turtle, to get the two figures to line up.

On the other hand, when Monica tried to make a triangle, she had great difficulty separating the different variables.  She worked steadily for an hour, trying to make a triangle that would close.  Her problem was, that she worked without an effective system.  She had to deal with five different variables (three lengths and two angles).  She had a hard time fixing on which one to vary, and so, kept getting close to a solution, only to have her next attempt produce something quite different.  She used two different strategies as she worked, and kept switching between them.  She got quite confused about what was happening, and never succeeded in getting the triangle to close.  I was very impressed with how doggedly she stuck to the task and how close she came to a solution without actually getting one.

In the seventh class, Monica copied a triangle procedure which was state transparent, (FD 100, RT 120, repeated 3 times), and began to experiment with the effects of putting rotations in between triangles.  She put a whole series of triangles rotated at different angles, on top of each other.

Next time, I suggested that she give a name to a definite series of rotations.  I suggested that she could call TRI90 a series of repeats of TRI, LT 90; or TRI40 a series of repeats of TRI, LT 40 (both sequences she had used in the previous class).  Monica understood my idea about making each design a separate procedure, but her approach was a bit different.  She defined three new procedures:  

.nofill
.block 8
TO TRI4		TO TRI42	TO TRI442
1 TRI		1 LEFT 40	1 TRI4
2 LEFT 90	2 TRI4		2 TRI42
3 TRI		END		END
4 LEFT 90
5 TRI
6 LEFT 90
7 TRI
END

.adjust
These made the designs shown (figure M-1).  Notice that TRI42 was not used by itself, but only with TRI4, as part of TRI442.

.sp 17

Figure M-1

Most of the rest of the period, was devoted to a lengthy series of repeats of TRI, LT 10.  Monica's plan was to complete a circle of these with this shape, and then to teach it to the computer as a procedure.  After 13 repeats, a half circle was completed, and Monica concluded that 26 repeats would produce a full circle.  At this point, I introduced recursion to Monica, as an "easier" way to accomplish what she wanted to do.  She understood the idea, and used it to make:

.nofill

.block 5
TO FAN
1 TRI 
2 LT 10 
3 FAN
END

.indent 0
.ADJUST
and FANBOX, which combined a procedure made from four BOX procedures, with FAN, to make FANBOX. (figure M-2).  I also showed her how to add a stop rule to her FAN procedure, but here she did not understand, and made no attempt to use a stop rule at this point.

Figure M-2

Late in the period Monica copied another child's procedure from the bulletin board.  Because she miscopied the title, (It should have been FOO2, instead of FOO).  Her FOO has no graphic effect, but produced a "NO STORAGE LEFT.." error message.

.indent 6

80 FOO
90 FOO
100 FOO

120 FOO
130 FOO
END

This was a departure for Monica.  Usually she had tried each step of a procedure, then taught it to the computer.  Here she copied a procedure verbatim, without realizing that she also needed the subprocedure, FOO, and without checking to see that FOO itself worked.  At this point she did not ask for help, or try to debug FOO in any way, but went back to previous explorations.

In classes 9 and 10, Monica continued to work in ways which were becoming a definite pattern: she did more work along the line of THING, rotation, THING; she also did not debug procedures with errors, and ignored procedures which did not do what she wanted.  During class 10, she copied some more procedures from the bulletin board, and from a project book.  Most of these procedures did not work, either because of errors in copying (like to mistake she had made with FOO) or because she did not pay attention to the subprocedures needed in each case.

Monica recorded some of her difficulties in her notebook, without any attempt to analyze them:  "Today I made a DOODLE... and I tried two DOODLES but it wouldn't work out too well..and I tried to make a slinky." 

.nofill
.block 6
TO DOODLE		TO SLINKY
10 DOODLE		10 CIRCLE
20 DOODLE		20 FORWARD 10
30 DOODLE		30 SLINKY

END

In going over the dribble files for these classes, I realized that Monica was not looking carefully at what she was doing; that she was not editing or debugging; that she was following certain patterns blindly without thinking about them; and that she had run out of ideas for projects.  I decided that for the next class I would prepare a list of buggy procedures, discuss each procedure with Monica (and Kathy, who was having similar problems), and then have them try out the procedures to see what the computer would easily do in each case.  I had two major aims in doing this:  first, to get the girls to notice and focus on the messages sent by the computer in buggy situations.  Second, to get them to understand some of the particular kinds of bugs that they were experiencing.

Following this lesson, I noticed that Monica was doing some debugging, but that she was still having difficulty understanding how to use the EDIT command (she was following the ED command by a line number, rather than a procedure name).  We worked through one problem together, using PO, ED, and analyzing the procedure step by step.  In this way, I hoped to give Monica a model of how she could work in other situations without help.

In class 13, I introduced both Kathy and Monica to the idea of variables, by giving them a variable square procedure, SQ:SIZE.  I had also made up a little sheet of possible project ideas.  Monica and Kathy both chose to make a bus (figure M-3).

.block 6
.sp 4

Monica worked on the bus for parts of two periods.  Once again, she had problems editing, editing the line, rather than the procedure.  For example, her buswheel procedure was

.indent 6
.nofill
.block 5
TO BUSWHEEL
1 BUS
2 LT 90
3 RCIRCLE
END
.adjust

.indent 0
When she ran BUSWHEEL, she got the error message; "RCIRCLE NEEDS MORE MORE INPUTS AT LEVEL 1 LINE 3 IN BUSWHEEL."  Her response was to type ED RCIRCLE.  Clearly she was reading and interpreting the error message, and using the information to try to debug her work, but she did not understand the proper use of EDIT.

Another bug surprised me.  She had a problem with the turtle state, in aligning the wheels properly.  Her debugged procedure was:

.nofill
.indent 6

1 BUS

when used to make a complete bus:

makes a bus with a bug, shown in figure M-3.

Either Monica did not notice that the wheels were at different levels, didn't feel it was a problem or didn't want to bother with it.  She ignored it  deciding that the project was completed.  She went on to other work, going back to her old pattern of procedure, rotation, procedure, to produce some more nice designs (see, for example, figure M-4 for a way that Monica used her BUS procedure in a more familiar mode.)

.block 19
.sp 17
.ce
Figure M-4

In the next three classes (15, 16, and 17) she continued to use the rotation idea, sometimes with recursion, to make procedures like:  

.nofill
.block 5
TO DESIGN	TO DOG
1 STAR		1 BOX
2 RIGHT 40	2 RT 70
3 DESIGN	3 DOG
END		END

.adjust
Her projects were short, and she did not have to edit.  She did borrow one long procedure -- Kathy's XMASTREE, which Monica decided to call HAT.  In using this procedure she did have to edit, and asked me to help with the EDIT command.

Although Monica had been using rotations to produce designs, it was very obvious, that she had not developed any particular sense of the effect of using particular angles.  She had used rotations of 10, 20, 40, and occasionally 70 or 90 degrees in her designs.  Although she did seem to prefer "dense" designs, she seemed to have no way of predicting the effect of using a particular angle, or the sense that certain "special" angles might produce nice designs that "closed" in a predictable way.

I decided to suggest that Monica write some new procedures that used a variable angle, so that she could experiment with the effect of changing the angle.  I showed Monica a couple of models like:

.nofill
.indent 6
.block 6
TO SPINBUS : ANGLE 
10 BUS
20 RT :ANGLE
30 IF HEADING = 0 STOP
40 SPINBUS :ANGLE
END

.adjust
.indent 0
The use of the stop rule, was another suggestion of mine, to help Monica focus on when the design was "complete"  Monica used this model to define procedures that would rotate her HAT procedure, her WOW procedure (a series of nested squares) and her HOUSE procedure.

In typing these procedures, Monica had some difficulties with syntax.  She usually left out the :ANGLE in the procedures title.  I showed her how to use EDT.  Now she was using ED properly, but still had difficulty with EDT. She did, however, correctly interpret the error messages, and debug the procedures on her own.

In class 21, I asked Monica to choose one of her procedures, and experiment with varying the input, keeping records of the results.  She chose to use the procedure 


	WISHWOW :ANGLE 

which rotates a bunch of nested squares. (figure M-5)

.epage 1
She kept meticulous notes in her notebook, describing what the shapes looked like, how they grew,  and comparing them with similar shapes.  For example:

.indent 6
"WISHWOW 160 looked the same as WISHWOW 40.  It had thin cones and there were 9 of them.

WISHWOW 165 had thin webbed cones and you couldn't really see them that good.

WISHWOW 190 had cones but they looked like they didn't close up.  And it was fatter than other ones.  It had more squares and cones.  The cones were thin.  And close together.

WISHWOW 45, WISHWOW 90.  These 2 look almost the same but WISHWOW 45 looks like it goes twice around instead of once.  And the cone shaped things on the sides are bigger than the WISHWOW 90 ones."

.indent 0
Class 21 turned out to be the last time Monica actually worked on a project.  Clearly, she was making some interesting "discoveries" about angles.  If she had gone on, I would have suggested that she compare two procedures -- for example, WISHWOW and SPINBUS, with the same inputs.  I would also have suggested comparing other inputs which involved simple rations (as she had already done with 45 and 90).  I would have suggested some kind of chart to help organize the information she was gathering.  All these things would have allowed her to consolidate her discoveries about angles.

At the end of the period, Monica expressed interest in "fixing" the christmastree (see Figure M-6). We began to work on this project as well.  If Monica had returned to work on this one, I believe that she would have solidified her ideas about editing and debugging, and could have developed a stronger sense of the "step-by-step" working of the computer.

Because each of Monica's individual "projects" had been very short and simple, Monica had not developed a sense of urgency about "finishing" any of her work before the end of the series of classes.  Although I can see how some important continuations, consolidations and clarifications could have occured during the next few classes, I believe that Monica had no such sense of continuity.  Although she probably would have enjoyed continuing, she was also quite content to stop her work at this point.

Throughout the classes, Monica seemed to be most comfortable learning by direct imitation of examples or models supplied. In this way she learned to write procedures utilizing simple recursion, variables and stop rules.  If the context was shifted, or a small mistake led to a bug, Monica was often stuck.  She usually chose not to analyze her mistakes, nor did she undertake long projects requiring advanced planning, or a large number of subprocedures.  Near the end of the series of classes Monica gradually began to be comfortable with editing, and to understand how to analyze a procedure in a step by step fashion.  

Monica's investment in any particular project was slight -- she could easily discard it without debugging if a problem occurred, and go on to a new activity, which might prove succesful.  She had a large number of small procedures, which allowed her to feel successful most of the time she was working, without having to confront her confusions.  Her dribble files show numerous ideas sidetracked without debugging -- and apparently without any strong feelings of disappointment.  In this way, Monica was able to function comfortably in an environment which was more complex than her understanding of it.  When she did successfully assimilate a concept (as she was beginning to do with editing and debugging) she did not look back to old problems, to see if she could solve them now with her new tool.  Rather, she unselfconsciously applied the new idea to whatever new problems arose.  The old problems had been conveniently forgotten.

It is possible that Monica would have benefitted from being able to use a carefully designed set of worksheets structured to lead her from one concept to another with many small projects along the way.
