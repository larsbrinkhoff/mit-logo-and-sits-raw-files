Individual Profiles; Donald

Donald's work was characterized by a good understanding of formal approaches to problem
solving, combined with some difficulty understanding details of geometry.  He was especially good at naming procedures and subprocedures, using and understanding top-down planning, making use of mathematical analysis in planning his work, and understanding the function of conditionals and stop rules.  At the same time, he tended to have difficulties working 
"experimentally" with turtle geometry -- often not quite sure where the turtle would move next.

Donald spent most of his class time on one long-term project:  making the computer draw an elaborate head, which included a beard, hair, a hat and a flower, in addition to the 
usual features: eyes, ears, nose and mouth.  He worked for twelve class periods on this project.  He began by drawing a picture of what he wanted the head to look like, and following the teacher's suggestion, wrote out a superprocedure to draw the head, using subprocedures to add each of the features.  In the course of his work, Donald had to do a great deal of
estimating of distances and angles, use arc and circle procedures, use procedures that repeat, use variables to control size and angles, and especially, learn to separate a problem into parts, to make it easier to solve.  In addition, he used a POLY procedure to make a FLOWER for his head, and had to use recursion, as well as a conditional stop rule.

Throughout his work, Donald had difficulty in understanding the effect of the state of the turtle at any given time.  He could not always predict where the next step would occur.  At times it seemed as if he had difficulty in seeing exactly where the turtle was headed.  The teaching strategy employed to help Donald deal with these problems, was to help him develop tools of mathematical
analysis in order to figure out the best way to aim the turtle, without relying totally on experimentation.  He
was shown how to use a kind of "grid" to help him maneuver the turtle around his HEAD,
and how to use the total angle already turned by the turtle in a given situation, to decide how much farther to turn it next.  In addition, he was shown how to break up even a small problem into
parts. In placing a mouth on his face, for example,  he was able to
separate the problem into three sub-problems: the starting point for the
mouth, the orientation of the turtle before drawing the mouth, and
which size arc to use.  Thus, he was helped to overcome obstacles that might have interfered with his success while learning principles of geometry, computer programming, design and planning.

Donald's first independent project presents a good
example of the difficulties that he had with his work as well
as the resourcefulness with which he overcame them.  The project was making a
"house" using previously defined procedures that draw a triangle and a box.  He had developed the BOX procedure on the first day of classes, along with the rest of the kids, but he had been absent during two classes when the children all defined triangles.

Donald's basic strategy was to try to get the turtle to point A of the triangle, and then use his BOX procedure.  (BOX made a square by turning right.)
He had difficulty
figuring out how to orient the turtle properly.  Although he came close
by trial and error,
he did not keep adequate notes, and did not realize how close he was.  

Donald's difficulty was due to the fact that he had established a
framework for the problem in terms of the initial orientation of the
triangle.  He then had to deal with
two disorientations -- the problem of the "gap" between the TRI and BOX procedures, and the tilted orientation of the whole shape.  When
it was suggested that Donald make a plan by drawing a picture of the house he was trying to construct, he drew a tilted house!

The solution that was suggested to him at the next class was to drop
the plan which started with the triangle and to
begin again, starting with the BOX.  Once he did this, he was able to
analyze the problem in a way that made it unnecessary to rotate the
turtle to place the triangle on the BOX.  He simply moved the turtle to the upper right hand corner of the BOX, turned it around, and used the TRI procedure, so that the first leg of the triangle was along the top of the BOX.

Donald's major project, which lasted for four weeks and occupied twelve
class periods, was to 
make a man's face, complete with beard, hair, hat and flower.  He began
by drawing the following picture in his notebook at the beginning of class 9.

After working on the project for a few days he
modified his plan somewhat, and drew this picture, which simplified the ears and the hair, and added a moustache:

His completed project, shown in figure D-7, looked almost exactly like
his second plan (with the exception of the moustache which Donald omitted).

Donald began by spending one period trying to draw
the entire head as a long series of direct commands.  At the next class
he and the teacher sat down together and developed a framework for
doing the problem by breaking it into smaller parts.  A superprocedure
was written to serve as both an overall plan for solving the problem,
and as a procedure for drawing the head.  Donald included in his
initial superprocedure the most important features which he intended to
include in the head.  Additional features, such as the ears, hat and
flower, were left to be added later.  Donald's original superprocedure
was:

2 EYES
3 NOSE
4 MOUTH
5 BEARD
6 HAIR

Using a superprocedure, and "top-down planning" was a major
breakthrough for Donald.  It meant he could concentrate on one step at
a time, and not worry about having to lose or erase the picture of what
had gone before.  It allowed him to keep track of both his overall
goal, and of exactly what he had accomplished at every stage of his
work.  After completing the EYES and NOSE, for example, when Donald
gave the command HEAD, the computer would draw the head, in its
incomplete state (see figure D-l0) and print the following message:
.nofill
.indent 6
.block 2
YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME HOW TO MOUTH
AT LEVEL 1 LINE 4 IN HEAD

.indent 0
.adjust
Donald's problem of building the head was thus reduced to a series of
separate problems, which could each be solved in turn.  For each
feature, EYES, NOSE, MOUTH, etc., Donald had to figure out where to
locate the turtle to begin drawing the feature, and the steps necessary
to draw the feature itself.  In some cases (MOUTH, BEARD, and HAT, for
example), these two aspects of the problem were closely interrelated.
In others (EYES, NOSE, HAIR, EARS) the location of the feature was
relatively independent from the steps necessary to draw it.

To show how Donald solved the problem of building a head, we will first
present an outline of his overall solution, including his
superprocedure and each of his sub-procedures.  The outline is
annotated to show exactly how the solution was achieved.  Donald's work
in developing a few of his key subprocedures, MOUTH, BEARD and HAT,
will be analyzed in detail, to give a sense of how Donald worked on
specific problems in a step by step fashion.

In developing each of the subprocedures outlined above, Donald had to
solve two related problems:  how to use turtle commands to draw the
feature, and where to place the turtle before starting to draw the
feature.  As he worked, Donald created each feature in the order listed
in the superprocedure, HEAD.  The subprocedure for each new feature had
to begin where the previous one left off.  Each new feature presented a
new challenge, and since Donald had difficulty solving problems by
experimentation alone, he needed to develop analytical skills in order
to divide each of his subprocedures into its sub-parts, and to solve
each sub part.  Donald's work in drawing three key features, the mouth,
beard and hat, will now be discussed in order to illustrate the
problems he encountered and the analytical skills he developed to
resolve them.

Donald decided to use an arc procedure to draw the mouth on his head
(see figure D-ll).  In order to place the mouth on the face in a
symmetrical position, Donald had to coordinate four different aspects
of the problem:

.indent 6
.nofill
.block 4
-- where to place the turtle in order to draw the mouth
-- at which angle to orient the turtle to draw the mouth
-- the size of the input to be used with the arc procedure
-- whether to use a right or left turning arc procedure.

.adjust
.indent 0
Donald spent most of one period experimenting unsuccessfully, varying
these elements in an uncoordinated way.  The teacher then suggested
working separately on the different aspects of the problem, and working on them
separately, to facilitate a solution.  It was also suggested that
Donald clear the screen and work on the mouth by itself, without the
rest of the face, to simplify the process.

At the beginning of the next period, Donald sat down with the teacher
for a "lesson" on the geometry of quarter arcs.  Since Donald knew that
four arcs made a complete circle and that the turtle turned through 360
degrees in completing a circle, he realized through discussion, that
each arc procedure turned the turtle 90 degrees.  Using this fact, and
taking note of the horizontal position of the turtle after finishing drawing the
nose (figure D-10), he was able to figure out that the turtle had to be
turned through an angle of 135 degrees to orient the turtle so that it
would draw a symmetrical curve.
.block 8
.sp 6
.ce
Figure D-16

Once he understood how to orient the turtle, it was easy for Donald to
determine a size for the mouth that corresponded with the other
features of his head, and to locate the starting point for the mouth by
trial and error.  He did this by moving the turtle over from where the
nose ended, until the arc was positioned symmetrically in the center of
the head (see figure D-11).

In order to draw a beard on his head, Donald also had to separate his
problem into three different aspects:
.nofill
.indent 6
.block 6
--how to draw the beard

--where to locate and orient the turtle to draw the beard

--how to move the turtle to that point, from the point where the MOUTH
subprocedure ended.

.indent 0
.adjust
Here, the teacher provided a suggestion for drawing the beard, which
Donald accepted.  The beard was to be drawn as a series of "lines", all
emanating from a single point.  As the turtle moved, it kept its pen up
for most of the line, putting the pen down only to draw the "hair" of
the beard (Figure D-17).

.block 12
.sp 10
.ce
Figure D-17

In writing his procedure STRING (see page@@@), Donald decided how long
the PENUP and PENDOWN portions of the line would be, as well as how
much to rotate the turtle each time the line was repeated.  Once STRING
was defined, he had to figure out how many repeats he wanted, as well
as how to orient the turtle to make the beard symmetrical.  After a few
tries he figured out that if he turned the turtle RIGHT 15 (from a
straight down position) and repeated STRING 15 times, he would get a
symmetrical beard (See figure D-17).

Now Donald had to center the turtle at the top of the head,
in order to draw the beard on
the face.  (The turtle was oriented at an angle of 45 degrees to the
horizontal after drawing the mouth.  See figure D-11.  At first
Donald tried to orient it vertically by trial and error -- but had
difficulty finding the correct angle.  A short geometry lesson helped
him realize that the turtle needed an additional rotation of 45 degrees
to be heading in the proper direction.  From that point he was able to
easily center the circle on the top of his head.  He found that he
still needed to move it a distance of ten turtle steps below the
top of the head, in order to locate the beard properly below the mouth.
 The steps required to accomplish this are given in his procedure BEARD
(Page. @@@).

In placing a hat on the head, Donald once again had to coordinate
several related factors:
.indent 6
.nofill
.block 7
--the size of the box needed to draw the hat itself

--the overall width of the brim

--the distance the turtle had to move in from the edge of the brim
before drawing the box, in order to make it symmetrical.

.indent 0
.adjust
This time Donald worked out the problem on his own, using a variable
box procedure, LBOX :SIZE, that he had developed at an earlier stage of
his work.  Once again, Donald had difficulty coordinating all the
variables.  This time, he invented a kind of "coordinate system" to
help him keep track of what he was doing:  after each try he counted
the "hairs" on both sides of his hat to see if it was centered.
Although his final result was not exactly symmetrical he was able to
obtain a satisfactory solution using this approach (see figure D-15).
 
In summarizing Donald's work we note that his was the longest and most
"involved" Turtle Geometry project undertaken by any of the children in our trial classes.  By using the top-down mode of operation, he was able to understand both the overall goal, and where he was in the process at any particular moment.  Thus he was able to meet each challenge 
as just one small problem to be overcome, so that he did not become discouraged about the whole project.

Perhaps the most striking thing about Donald's work was that he was
not usually able to solve his problems by experimentation and visual examination of the results.  From his first HOUSE procedure, right through the HEAD, all the way to the FLOWER, he made use of analysis, combined with experimentation to solve his problems.  He often needed help with the analysis, but he understood
the analytical techniques he was shown and he was able to make use of them.
Scattered throughout his notebook are little drawings on graph paper,
either by Donald or the teacher, showing how he analyzed his work.
It was his regular use of drawings like these that distinguished
Donald's work from that of his classmates.  A few of them are presented
here in figure D-18.
