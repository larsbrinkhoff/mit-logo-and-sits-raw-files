Kenny is a boy who has severe learning difficulties in standard school
subjects.  He is several years behind his peers in basic academic
skills, and has been diagnosed as having a "learning disability".  He
receives regular individual assistance in the school's Learning Center.
Kenny is large for his age and somewhat awkward in manner.  He has few
friends among his classmates, other than a few selected "cronies".

When Kenny was interviewed, prior to his participation in LOGO some
significant gaps occurred between his abilities in tasks that required
reading, writing, arithmetic, and verbal expression, and those that
required non-verbal problem solving.  While appearing to be virtually
unable to read or carry out a calculation in arithmetic, he readily solved
problems involving number patterns, attributes of different shapes, and
was able to systematically generate all twenty-four permutations of a
set of cubes of four different colors.  Questions that were designed to
elicit Kenny's feelings about school, and about himself and friends,
were answered with statements like:  "I don't care", "nothing", "No",
and "I don't know".

Despite extreme difficulty using the computer keyboard, Kenny did very
well in the LOGO classes.  From the beginning he enjoyed the sense of
control he felt while participating in LOGO activities.  While Kenny
often needed help remembering the spelling of various commands, he was
able to make use of his logical and organizational abilities in a
variety of contexts.  Kenny's accomplishments in the LOGO classes
regularly surpassed what he was normally considered able to do in his
regular classes and in his special tutoring sessions.  At present,
Kenny's teachers are trying to decide how to take into account the
information learned during his successful LOGO experience, in planning
his regular school work.

In the sections that follow, we will review Kenny's major
accomplishments, as well as some of the difficulties that he experienced.

1I. Kenny's Major Accomplishments0
.br
Kenny's accomplishments in the LOGO classes fit into two categories:
he developed a processes both for working with the computer and
for planning and debugging his work, and he completed a number of
successful projects in the area of Turtle Geometry, culminating in a
keyboard controlled animation, in which he could drive the turtle
around the screen.

At first Kenny's work alternated between carefully planned designs and
the haphazard use of commands that he did not really understand.  As he
began to discover consistencies in the effects produced by different
commands, he gradually came to exercise more and more control over the
outcomes of his work.

.epage 1
Kenny's first projects, the rectangle, TAM and the set of repeated
rectangles, CULLEN, were carefully planned and carried out.  (Figure
Kar-l).  His next design, ACE (figure Kar-2) was even more carefully
structured, making use of symmetry and the properties of circles.  
When he became fascinated by the effects of SPIN commands, he began to
add procedures together randomly to produce unexpected results.  He
would sit for long periods of time watching the effects of rapid SPINs
interacting with various procedures.  Each time he had a new idea for a
project, he would add it to the others, to enjoy the wild unpredictable
effects.  Some of the procedures he created this way were:
.nofill
.ss
.block 8
TO ACE2		TO ME		TO ACE3
1 SPIN 1020	1 TAM		1 SPIN 1020
2 ACE		2 CULLEN	2 TAM
END		3 ACE		3 ACE
		4 ACE2		4 ACE2
		END		5 ME
				6 HIDETURTLE
				END

By class 9, these procedures culminated in:

1 SPIN 200
2 CULLEN
3 ACE
4 ACE2
5 ME
6 NO
7 NO
8 XX78055
9 PLUS
10 TAM
END

.ds

The procedure NO was a sequence of slow SPINs and FORWARD commands,
followed by HOME, while XX78055 and PLUS were carefully planned spinning
designs created by using NO, rotating the turtle 10 degrees, and then
repeating the process while increasing the angle of rotation by 10
degrees each time.

[Include the procedures NO, XX75055 and PLUS]


A few classes after creating BU, Kenny expressed the desire to
control the effects of his procedures.  In one period he edited BU
to produce a very elegant spinning design, by systematically removing
all the "random effects."  Although he needed help with the mechanics
of editing, the decisions about what to change were all his.  The final
version of the procedure was:
.ss
.nofill
.indent 6
.block 7
TO BU
1 SPIN 200
2 CULLEN
3 ACE
4 HOME
9 PLUS
END

.ds
.indent 0
.adjust
The HOME command at line 4 was introduced to center the turtle before
carrying out the symmetrical spinning design, PLUS.  

The editing of BU ended the "random phase" of Kenny's work.  Although
he had periods of aimlessness, and fooling around with the keyboard,
most of his actual work with the computer was carefully and purposefully
planned in the classes that followed.

In addition to thoughtful geometrical planning (TAM, CULLEN, ACE, PLUS,
etc.) and careful step-by-step debugging (as in his editing of BU),
another process that Kenny used to great advantage was finding the
limits allowed by the computer in different areas.

For example, he used the process of successive approximations in
converging to a limit, to find the largest input to SPIN.  It took him
nine tries, using successive inputs of 1000, 2000, 1050, 1001, 1010,
1040, 1020, 1030, 1025 before deciding that 1020 was the largest
allowable input to SPIN.  In doing this, he made use of the error
message generated by the computer whenever he used an input that was
too large.

In a similar fashion, he used the OUT OF BOUNDS error message and the
method of successive approximation to find the boundaries of the
display screen and the diagonal distance across it.

Kenny also experimented with other limits of the computer system.  He
found the shortest procedure name (one letter) and the "longest" (his
procedure QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBN used every alphabetic symbol on the
keyboard).  He also found out what happened when you type very long
numbers.  (When he typed PR 900000000000000000000, the computer
responded: 9.000002E31), or long strings of symbols.  In general, he
developed an experimental approach to the system -- "asking questions
of it," by trying things, and seeing what happened.

Kenny's major accomplishment was a set of procedures which he used to
animate the turtle in such a way that he could "drive it around" the
screen.  He was given the initial concepts for the procedures  and
filled in the specific instructions himself.  The procedure ideas he
was given were:
.ss
.nofill
.block 7
TO CAR		TO CH
5 PENUP		10 MAKE "LETTER KEY
10 MAKE "D 10	20 IF :LETTER = "R RT 30
20 CH		30 IF :LETTER = "L LT 30
30 FD :D	END
40 GO 20
END

.ds
.adjust
The comand KEY was given as a "primitive" which "tells the computer which
letter you type on the keyboard."

Using this basic idea,  Kenny was able to define a system of commands
that made the activity interesting to him.

First he decided what commands he wanted, and what letters he could use
for them.  He decided to locate all the letters in one section of the
keyboard to make them easier to locate.  He wanted to slow the turtle
down, and to have it wrap around the screen without going out of
bounds, so he added WRAP and WAIT 5 commands to his CAR procedure.  He
wanted to be able to decide whether or not to leave a trace, so he
added PENDOWN and PENUP commands.  After some discussion with the
teacher, he decided that the speed of motion could be controlled by
increasing or decreasing the size of each step, so he added steps to
take care of that.  Over a period of three or four classes he edited his
procedures as follows:
.ss
.nofill
.block 10
TO CAR		TO CH
1 WRAP		10 MAKE "LETTER KEY
5 PENUP		20 IF :LETTER = "R RIGHT 30
10 MAKE "D 10	30 IF :LETTER = "W LEFT 30
20 CH		40 IF :LETTER = "F MAKE "D :D + 5
25 WAIT 5	50 IF :LETTER = "S MAKE "D :D - 5
30 FORWARD :D	60 IF :LETTER = "A PENUP
40 GO 20	70 IF :LETTER = "Q PENDOWN
END		80 IF :LETTER = "E MAKE "D 0
		END

.ds

Notice that the letters "R" (right turn), "F" (faster), "S" (slower),
and "E" (emergency stop), all are abbreviations for their functions
while the letters "W", "A" and "Q" were chosen for their position on
the keyboard.

Having created a very nice "toy" with the computer, Kenny enjoyed
playing with it a lot.  He made some nice discoveries as he moved it
playfully around the screen.  For example, he found that repeatedly
pressing "S" would eventually make the turtle go backwards at an
accellerating rate.  Or that he could draw a dotted line by alternating
the keys "A" and "Q".  He tried letting the car go very fast, drawing
slanted lines wrapping around the screen, and experimented with the
effect of many repeats of the same commands.  At one point he realized
that he could use this device to write his name in script -- but this
was never fully completed.

Procedure TR here

Between periods of playing with his "car" Kenny continued to pursue the
idea of a racetrack, around which the car could be driven.  He created
the procedure TR to draw the racetrack using circles, and included a
starting and finishing lines.  In the last class he was beginning to
work  on a series of procedures that would allow the computer to keep
track of the elapsed time for one circuit of the track.  Although the
project was not completed, Kenny was able to define the logical
structure of the race in a way that would have allowed a relatively
easy translation to a set of computer procedures, had there been more time.

1II. Major Difficulties Encountered by Kenny in His Work0
.br
Kenny's difficulties were related to his problems in reading and
writing, based on hearing difficulties and a very poor visual memory.
This was reflected in his painfully slow and poorly coordinated
approach to using the keyboard.  When Kenny wanted to find a particular
letter on the keyboard, he would scan the keyboard with his eyes,
moving his finger back and forth, as his eyes shifted.  Often his
finger would pass the correct key several times before hitting it.  If
a wrong key was hit, an error message would result, and the whole
process would begin again.  Although Kenny gradually improved his
typing, his difficulty finding familiar keys continued to be noticeable.

Kenny used the same random scanning strategy for finding numbers, as
well.  Although he knew that the numbers were on the top line of the
keyboard, he was unable to make use of their inherent order to make
them easier to find.  This was particularly striking when he was
numbering steps in a procedure.  Going in a sequence, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
he conducted an individual "search" for each number, using his scanning
and finger moving technique.

Another area in which Kenny had great difficulty was in reading error
messages.  Although he gradually learned to include the new terminology
in his sight vocabulary, he was unable to sound out words, even though
he had seen them before.  He either "knew" a word, or could not read it.
Before long, he had become familiar with the most common error
messages, and knew how to respond to them.  He continued to have a
problem whenever an unfamiliar error message appeared.

To help overcome these difficulties Kenny made regular use of his notebook
for writing the names of LOGO commands and of new procedures.  He
referred to these when he needed to recall the spelling or syntax of an
insruction that he had already learned.  When he had a list of commands
on the screen that he wanted to copy into his notebook, he often asked
either a teacher, or another student for help.

Kenny also helped himself by limiting the size of his procedure names.
He quickly realized that he could make procedure names very short;
sometimes he wrote abbreviations for LOGO primitives (RC and LC for
RCIRCLE and LCIRCLE, for example).  Although he eventually used
two and three letter names exclusively, he did not seem to choose his letters in a
way that made scanning easier.  Procedure names like TAM, ACE, CULLEN,
and BU, all required a fair amount of scanning.

In class 13, Kenny named a procedure QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM making
use of every letter of the alphabet, in their keyboard sequence.  Since
he could move his finger in order across all the letters, this name
required no scanning, and was actually a lot easier for him to type than
a three letter procedure name for which he had to scan.

When designing his CAR procedures, he did make use of keyboard
placement, in choosing the keys he used to control the motion of the
turtle.  The letters he used- - Q, W, E, R, A, S, and F -- are all
located in a group on the left hand end of the keyboard.  Originally
Kenny thought he would make a cardboard cover for the keyboard, with a
hole cut in it so that only those letters could be seen.  He found this
to be unnecessary, however, and concentrating his attention on one
small corner of the keyboard, was able to select the correct keys
easily, without any of the scanning or memory problems that occurred
when he had the entire keyboard as his field.

Given Kenny's extreme difficulties with reading and with the keyboard,
it seems significant that he persevered as consistently as he did in
his LOGO work.

1III. Affective Aspects of Kenny's LOGO Experience.0
.br
At the beginning of the LOGO classes, Kenny tended to have "deadpan"
expressions at all times.  This corresponded to his appearance when seen
for interviews, or on random occasions throughout the school.  Even
when he was successful in using the computer for the first few
sessions, his expression continued to be blank and non-committal.

As his success continued, Kenny became more assertive and curious.  He
asked what error messages meant, and sought to understand how to use
new commands.  He made a point of finding out how to use the
Plotter and Printer, so that he could make his own "hard copy" of his
computer work.  Observing this during class 13, a regular observer
wrote:  "Kenny seems more activey involved, engaged with, and using the
computer, based on more of his own interests, curiousities, purposes,
and playfulness.  Today he enquired about the other equipment; and was
interested in its functioning and products...Kenny many times today is
asking `how' giving the impression of one interested in how things are
done..."

At about the same time, Kenny began to express an interest in the work
of other children in his group, and began to show them his work.  In
class 15, he invited a friend to class and swapped programs with him.
Starting in class 14, during which he and Deanne played with the
mechanical floor turtle, Kenny began to show that he was feeling good
and enjoying himself.  His face was more expressive, his posture more
relaxed.  He wrote his name in large block letters on a formica table
which was used by the children as a graffiti board", and proudly began
to show his work to visitors.

In class 24, Kenny brought his tutor from the school's learning center,
and showed her his partially completed "car" project, carefully
explaining each detail of his programs to her.  In class 25, the
observer quoted above again noted changes in his behavior:  "Kenny
entered the room with Joey and Deanne.  He immediately set to logging
in on terminal 4.  I notice that he seems to walk taller with a more
self-assured posture and has a way of getting right to the business at
hand."

Changes in Kenny's attitude toward his classroom work were also noted
by his regular teacher.  After class 20 she reported that Kenny was
beginning to show that he really cared about his school work, that he
had begun concentrating on his work in a way that she had not seen
before, and that he seemed to have a great deal more confidence in his
ability to carry out academic tasks.  She attributed these changes
directly to his feeling of success in the LOGO classes.

Kenny's success in his LOGO classes demonstrated that with an
appropriate educational environment, he was able to function at a
higher level of abiity than he had demonstrated in schoolwork, even
with a great deal of one-to-one tutoring.  At the present time (fall,
1978) his seventh grade teachers and his learning disability tutors are
trying to develop an educational plan for him that will capitalize on
the abiities he has demonstrated in the areas of reasoning, logic,
planning and organization, in order to help him maintain the feelings
of success that he developed while working on LOGO.

In his final interview, after the end of the LOGO classes, Kenny was
significantly more articulate about intellectual activities (although
ot about his feelings).  He listed ten uses for a tin can (as opposed
to four uses for a brick in the first interview).  Instead of carrying
out the four color permutation task, he asked "can I just show you how
I do it?" and proceeded to describe a system for finding six
permutations that started with each of four colors.  With some
difficulty, he correctly calculated that there were twenty four
possibilities in all, and leaning oer to speak directly into the
interviewer's tape recorder, he said: "twenty-four.  I'm a brain!"
