1I. A Comparison of the Work of Deborah and Donald:  Two Heads ARe
More Interesting Than One
.br
0Deborah and Donald, students in two different classes both carried
out similar projects.  Both students made the computer draw a picture
of a head.  Deborah's was a "rabbit", Donald's a "man with a beard".
Both projects involved the use of sub-procedures and superprocedures,
and both projects took several classes to complete.  Both used
subprocedures to draw the different features of the head, and both
students used a method which combined advance planning of the overall
design, together with a trial and error approach to work out the details.

The two drawings, and the superprocedures used to draw them are shown
in Figure C-1.

Although the similarities between outcomes of the two projects is
clear, the way the two students carried out the projects was strikingly
different.  Donald wrote out his superprocedure, HEAD, when he began
work, and defined each subprocedure as he went along, to carry out its
specific function.  Deborah's superprocedure was written last, after
all of its elements had already been defined.  Donald had clear
functional names for each of his subprocedures, while Deborah's naming
was inconsistent.  Deborah had an excellent intuitive grasp of which
inputs to use for FORWARD and RIGHT and LEFT commands to draw the
features of her rabbit, while Donald had a poor intuitive sense of
Turtle Geometry, and relied largely on mathematical analysis to draw
each of the features of his head, Donald absorbed a lot of new ideas in
mathematics, computer programming and problem solving, while Deborah
relied mainly on soldifying ideas with which she was already familiar
before she started her project.  These differences will now be examined
in more detail.

11. Planning and the Use of Superprocedures
.br
0Donald and Deborah each began with a drawing of how they expected
their finished project to look.  Once they had drawn a picture, each of
them made an initial attempt to draw the entire figure using direct
commands.  Once they saw that this was too large a task for them to
accomplish in one single procedure, each of them was shown how to carry
out the project more easily by making use of subprocedures.

Donald began by his superprocedure, TO HEAD, in a way that included
most of the significant details that he planned to include.  In this
way his superprocedure itself became a specific plan for the project he
was attempting to carry out.

Deborah, on the other hand, carried her plan in her head.  She did
define different subprocedures as she went along, generally dividing
the whole project into more managable chunks.  Her superprocedure, TO
RABBIT, was written last, after her entire rabbit head had been built.
RABBIT includes both subprocedures and a large number of direct
commands which Deborah used to draw the rabbit's ears.

11. The Naming of Subprocedures0
.br
Donald's subprocedures were consistently named according to the part of
the head that they drew.  The only exception was BOX which was used to
draw the outline of the head.  Some of his subprocedures had names that
told how they "worked".  STRING, drew one "hair" of a beard; LBOX made
a box of variable size; POLY drew a polygon.  Others had functional
names:  HAIRY drew one "hair" of a head of hairs and EAR drew one ear.

Deborah's naming was much less consistent.  In some cases she was able
to think of an appropriate name for a subprocedure.  In other cases she
picked something else that came to mind.  Her procedure HAT drew the
outside of the rabbit's face.  LITTLEEYES drew the eyes -- it got its
long name because Deborah alread had a different procedure called EYES.
NOSE made the rabbit's nose out of two arcs, but the procedure which
moved the turtle from where LITTLEEYES finished, to the center of the
face, in order to draw the nose was called FACE.  The procedure EARS
drew only on of the rabbit's ears.  Only one of Deborah's
subprocedures, FACE, contained a subprocedure, NOSE, within it.

13. "Intuitive" vs. "Analytic" Approach to Turtle Geometry
.br
0Deborah was able to make use of a powerful visual intuition in
making designs with the turtle.  In her earliest experimentation with
inputs to turtle commands, she limited herself to multiples of ten, and
eventually came to use certain numbers, especially 30, 60 and 90, much
more often than others.  This led to a lot of successful design work.
For example, a rotation of 60 degrees was a perfect first guess for
drawing a six-pointed star.  By repeating a fixed rotation such as
RIGHT 30, a number of times, Deborah was able to make a variety of
angles including 90, 180, 270 and 360 degrees.  By using such a
"useful" set of limited numbers, Deborah was able to avoid analysis and
planning which were difficult for her.  She "knew" that if she repeated
RIGHT 30 often enough, she could get the turtle to go wherever she
wanted it, and could solve all her problems by experimentation, without
having to remember that 90 degrees makes a "right angle" or that 180
degrees turns the turtle to face in the opposite direction.  Similar
effects were obtained with FORWARD steps.  Deborah made a square of
side 120 by repeating FORWARD 90 FORWARD 30.  Later, she could easily
find the center of the square using FORWARD 30 FORWARD 30.

Deborah never consciously articulated the strategies she used for
choosing these particular inputs for turtle commands, or for solving
problems like "turning the turtle all the way around" by repeating a
series of RIGHT 30 commands.  She seemed to have an intuitive sense of
what would "work" rather than any conscious "plan" at all.

Donald, on the other hand, had very poor results when he tried to solve
problems
