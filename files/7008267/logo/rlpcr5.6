1What Do Microworlds Connect To^?0

^^^^^^^^^^Thus far I have related a numbers of experiences and proposed that those experiences gave rise to a collection of disparate cognitive structures.  I have argued that some of those structures are exceptionally important becauser they are the structural equivalent of powerful ideas.  The criteria of applicability, generality, and simplicity are relatively easy to document for any particular candidate as a powerful idea.  Papert's SYNTONICITY, by which he refers to the affective inheritance of a cognitive structure from its ancestors, is very difficult to apply with any precision.  To function as a powerful idea, suntonicity must be not only general and simple, it must be applicable to the solving of specific problems.  Is it so ?  If not, why not^?

^^^^^^^^^^The two key elements of syntonicty are bound together in the phrase "affective inheritance".  To note any inheritance at all, one must be able to trace some microworld back to a specific ancestor.  A second question to raise, possible only then, is whether or not whatever is observable as inherited has characteristics which we could agree are "affective".  We have succesfully established that Miriam's eventual comprehension of terms of coordinate geometry derived from a specific ancestor, MAKEDOTS.  We have argued, more speculatively, that the Rods world will function as a post cedent ancestor for the reconstruction of Design cluster microworlds.  Even some success at tracing new cognitive structures to their ancestors is worthwhile, but what is really needed is not such a local map of connection, but a more ambitious attempt to specify how these varieties of microworlds interconnect among themselves and with their most fundamental ancestors in development.  The value in such an attempt is to grapple with the question of why specific things may be easy to learn and others may be hard to learn.  Our answer is based on connectibility -- but before such an answer can be taken seriously at all, one must endeavor to be explicit about how particular microworlds connect to specific ancestral knowledges structures.

^^^^^^^^^^In "Two Geometries" we concluded that the coordinate geometry and turtle geometry microworlds were cognate, both separately descended from pre-existing structures of "personal geometry".  We have treated that ancestral knowledge as a monolithic thing -- and we are not alone in doing so.  Papert nowhere analyzes the kinesthetic system into clearly discriminated parts whose distinction has any particular bearing on the inheritance their descendents may exhibit.  Nor is he alone in this vagueness of description about how the preceeding structures of knowledge interact with their descendents.  Piaget's stage theory seems to close off classes of structures when they become "complete" with the consequence that the description of how some later developing structure relates to its specific ancestors is not attempted.  Let us noiw undertake that effort, based on the material presented here.

^^^^^^^^^^Piaget named the first two years of life the semsori-motor period and argued that all subsequent development depended the cosntruction of the knowledges appropriate to that period.  Any follower of the Piagetian tradition must recognize then that an attempt to unpack the styructure of the kinesthetic system is an important erndeavor even if undertaken in a tentative way and producing few results.  Where do we begin^? If we find clustering of structures a common feature of "any memory using mechanism" (as Minsky put it), should we not expect to find within the kinesthetic system clusters as well.  Further, should we not expect them to bve associated with the major moving organs, such as the legs, or the tongue^?  If that be granted, we can speculate that there should be at least these major subsystems within the kinesthetic system:
.br
^^^^^a.^body-centric^^^^^^^^somatic^subsystem^^^^^^where the self is
.br
^^^^^b.^leg-centered^^^^^^^^locomotive^subsystem^^^operations moving the self
.br
^^^^^c.^hand-centered^^^^^^^manual^subsystem^^^^^^^operations moving things relative to the self
.br
^^^^^d.^eye-centered^^^^^^^^visual^subsystem^^^^^^^recognition of remote things
.br
^^^^^e.^tongue-centered^^^^^verbal^subsystem^^^^^^^production and recognition of speech
.br
Others can be imagined as well.  Some may consider it absurd to imagine that the visual and verbal systems -- or any part of them -- could be considered as subsystems of the kinesthetic system.  Two points may help bring this description into a more acceptable balance.  I intend here no claim about how these subsystems interact.  Second, I do not claim that there is some superordinate system which organizes and controls that interaction.  The kinesthetic system may be no more than the sum of its parts (and others not in the list above).  When we speak vaguely or speculatively, and doing so is necessary from lack of decisive evidence, we will speak of the kinesthetic system and various entry points to that system, or ports, as above.

^^^^^^^^^^Is it sensible to say that the eye is an organ of movement ?  Most definitely.  The eye is never still, can not see when it is still.  Noton and Stark proposed (Sci.Am. when) that the very recognition of figures in complex scenes is based upon stored data structures called a feature rings, a kinesthetic program defining saccades from point to point at which specific features are anticipated for mathcing an observed phenomenon to a memory.  Is language a kinesthetic system^? Perhaps language may be more than a kinesthetic system, but it is at least that, and if the recognition of particular speech patterns as semantically significant proceeds trough analysis by synthesis (one learns to recongize a word, for example, by comparing it to the production of other words one had learned before), then the kinesthetic component of the speech system may be even more significant than is generally admitted.


^^^^^^^^^^What are the entry points to the kinesthetic system for the navigation-like knowledge of turtle geometry^?  To the extent that Turtle geometry is "origin centered", an important entry point is somatic: HERE is the place from which every turtle geomtry operation executes,  To the extent that the movement and turning operation imply relocation or reorientation of the agent, another primary entry point is locomotive.  Whenever the task of the moment requires gross locomotion, one should assume connection is required through this port of the kinesthetic system.  Contrast now MAKEDOTS.  HERE is not imoprtant; THERE is.  Is a dot to be placed^? Is the location of an airplane to be determined^?  Both the recognition of figures and the remote location of objects indicates connection through the visual port.  The sense -- to answer our earlier question -- of why the turtle and coordiate geometryu systems are cognate is that they connect to distinct port of the kinesthetic system.  The question, then, is how they could possibly be related at all.  In this specific case, there is no evidence that they are related, at all.  Miriam tried to relate the terms of the R.A.F. game to movement but the "reality" (albeit a vicarious, constructed one) rebuffered her at every attempt.  In this sense, there is and can be no such thing as a "Navigation Cluster".  Grouping coordinate and turtle geometry together as descriptions of space requires an abstract perspective far removed from Miriam's capability.

^^^^^^^^^^There is clear evidence, in her "crawling on the bed game", that Miriam was able to relate movement (her own actions in crawling out the pattern) to the pattern itself which she held as her objective.  The difficulty of this achievment is witnessed by its place as the culmination of nearly a year of development -- but it was possible.  How, precisely, can we see this as sensible in this framework of relating new cognitive structures to ancestors ?  What of the Rods world ?  What of the Design worlds ?  Let's consider the Rods world first.

^^^^^^^^^^The primary characteristic of the Rods maze task was placement, not locomotion.  This argues that for Miriam there was no immediate and comprehensible relation to the turtle world of well understood locomotive operations.  It was Robby, recall, who made the initial connection between my laying out rods and the correct speculation about the objective of my procedure.  Even after Robby made that correct speculation, and his opinion was validated, for Miriam the relation between action and objective did not fall in place.  With direct instruction, however, Miriam was able to place the "next rod" in turn until the resource was exhausted.  Because her learning of what to do had very much the flavor of local learning -- learning how to perform a specific, limited task -- we feel further confident that her Rods world developed not from ancestral turtle geometry knowledge, and not from any Design bsed knowledge, but by imitation and through instruction using operations harking back to the basic kinesthetic system available through the  manual "entry" point.

^^^^^^^^^^The Design worlds present us with a major puzzle.  We have described them as a cluster of microworlds -- in a manner coherent with our prior setting based descriptions and one consonant with Miriam's actual experience -- and this does justice to her clear ability to get the various computer subsystems to work.  She learned "how" to use MPOLY, etc.  Those subsystems were sufficiently different from one another that confusion between was possible, did occasionally occur, and was subsequentlyu suppressed.  This description, however,  does not recognize the extensive overlap between the artifacts created by these subsystems.  Poly and Polyspi class designs were possile and common artifacts for Mpoly, Slot, Shapes, and Families worlds.  How could it be that all these supposedly different subsystems created only slightly different things ?  Miriam did not see the designs as generated by familiar operations.  Could there be any clearer evidence than her erroneous identification of the unit object of the POLY procedure (discussed in the section on TIMES) as a SQUARE.  Further, her classification of these design worlds artifacts was into these four categories: "stars, mazes, messes, and pretty flowers".  This clasification, her identification of shapes as units rather than lines made from movements, and finally the very difficulty itself she had in connecting her knowledge of turtle geometry navigation to designs convince me that the design microworlds all connect to the kinesthetic system through the visual entry point.  (Figure N summarizes these inferences on microworld connection.)

^^^^^^^^^^Where does the "crawling on the bed" game fit^?  It clearly relates something to something - but what to what and how ?  Notice that the design drew in her "crawling on the bed" game was a right polygonal spiral, i.e. exactly the form made with cuisenaire rods in the Rods maze task.  The bed game relates at least Miriam's world of turtle geometry to the Rods world; her drawing of the design on the 3^x^5 card shows he knowledge of how those actions relate to that artifact.  Does it go any further^?  We need not be convinced that it does; if we make any such claim we should have to cite further evidence, and none is available (but this lack is not definitive -- for two years after the end of The Intimate Study, Miriam had no access to the computer system on which these experiments were effected).  The data can not be pushed this far. 

^^^^^^^^^^We conclude that the simplest skecth of microworld connection to the more basic structures is as shown in Figure 7.   What conclusions can we draw from this analysis^?
