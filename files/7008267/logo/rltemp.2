^^^^^^^^^^We analyze in detail one child's learning to play Tic^tac^toe by focussing on the developing organization of disparate cognitive structures.  This interpretation extends an earlier analysis of the same child's learning (Lawler, 1981) in two directions.  We propose and apply a vision of how social engagement leads to the personal construction of mind.  Further, we trace how knowledge based on one's own actions can develop into structures capable of predicting another agent's choices and relate that development to domain-specific, stage-like changes in modes of thought. The six year old subject initially knew so little of Tic tac toe that she couldn't continue playing when confronted by an unanticipated response to her opening move in a game.  Six months later she was  playing both sides of the game, making "smart" moves for both players.  Two years later, she was able to prove predictions of victories by detailing the offensive use of forced moves in games worked out in her mind. The corpus of observations assembled during this period is rich in detail and reasonably complete in covering the child's overt behavior.
