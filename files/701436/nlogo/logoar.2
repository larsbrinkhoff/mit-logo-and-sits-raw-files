This is a file of LOGO "areas", that is, topics and issues that are
relativly independant from each other. The purpose of delinating these
areas is to decouple descions about the various areas from each other,
and, therefore, to allow developent of the critical (e.g. the evaluator)
areas to proceed without complete design of the non-critical areas (e.g.
the display oriented editor). Of course, it must also be realized that these
areas do overlap sometimes, e.g. display oriented editor and evaluator
block structure.

A) evaluator
	1) line evaluation
		a) parentheses
			i) IF grouping
			ii) multiple arguments
			iii) arithmetic grouping
		b) infix
		c) prefix
		d) eval-related primitives (IF, IFTRUE, IFFALSE, ELSE, UNTIL)
		e) special argument gobblers (PO, TO, EDIT, etc.)
	2) procedure evaluation
		a) variable scoping
		b) title line syntax
			i) locals
			ii) variable number of arguments
		c) invocations
		d) block structure
		e) GO
		f) line labels
		g) error handling
		h) debugging
			i) step
			ii) trace

B) reader
	1) errors at read time vs not
	2) storage of preparsed forms vs not
	3) token terminator issues (e.g. :,+, etc.)
	4) : for variable names
	5) : or what for labels
	6) procedure defining
		a) line numbers

C) primitives
	1) EVAL related (under evaluator)
	2) basic stuff (WORD, +, LIST, etc.)
	3) hairy stuff
		a) error related
		b) procedure related
	4) display stuff
	5) filing
	6) stream i/o
	7) debugging

D) editor
	1) line oriented
	2) display oriented
	3) interaction with LOGO programs (e.g. Seymour's escape key)
