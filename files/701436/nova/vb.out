Introduction

This memo is an attempt to capture our current views (no pun intended),
terminology, and plans with respect to Cedar documents, windows, desktops, etc.,
focusing on the display aspects of the above. We hope to begin more detailed
design and implementation very soon.

We found in our discussion the single biggest barrier to our own communication
and understanding was the lack of good terminology, complicated by the fact that
many of the more natural terms were extremely tainted by previous useage. Where
possible, we have tried to invent new terms, but in all cases, we will try to be
very explicit, and hopefully consistent, about our terminology.

Where a generic term is first introduced, e.g. document, window, display
context, it appears in bold face. Terms that are correspond to actual Mesa
identifiers, e.g. ScreenViewBox, TargetLocation, etc., will appear in Helvetica.
On the occasions that it is necessary, italic face is used for emphasis.
Finally, parenthetical, qualifying, or exceptional information, such as normally
would appear in footnotes, will appear in a small font. In general, such
information can be skipped by the reader who is just trying to get the gist of
this memo.

Terminology

A document is an object that knows how to, and can be asked to, display itself
(in a particular display context). (A document has other attributes, e.g. it can
be edited, executed, pointed at, etc. but for the purposes of this memo we will
primarily be focusing on the display aspects of documents.)  The object that a
document displays itself in is called a viewbox. In other words, when a document
is asked to display itself, it is asked to do so in a particular viewbox. The
relationship between this viewbox and the document displayed in it is that the
viewbox views the document. Every viewbox views one and only one document. The
document that is viewed by the viewbox is called the target document, or simply
target.  Note that it is the target document that decides how to display itself;
the viewbox is passive. In fact, the same document may be displayed
simultaneously in several different viewboxes, and may elect to do so in
different ways. e.g. a text document might want to format itself differently
depending on the size of the viewing area.

Each and every viewbox must "belong to" one and only one document. We will also
speak of the viewbox as "being contained in", "being a part of" or "residing in"
a particular document. This document that the viewbox resides in is called its
home document, or simply its home.  The following diagram illustrates these
terms and their relationships:

Relationship between Documents and Viewboxes



We wish to draw special attention to the following points about home and target
documents:

	Every document can be a target document for some viewbox. Indeed, this
is the sine qua non for documents: that they be able to be viewed. However, not
all documents will necessarily be home documents for any viewboxes. (If a
document is home for viewboxes, it must supply a procedure which will produce a
list of these viewboxes.)  For example, a document consisting of just a sequence
of characters does not contain any viewboxes.

9	The home document delegates responsibility for displaying the contents
of the viewboxes that reside in it to the corresponding target document, i.e.
the home document does not need to know anything about what appears inside the
viewboxes that it contains.

	The home document decides what parts of a viewbox are visible, i.e. the
home document decides overlap issues.

	The target document only paints in the areas specified by the home
document, i.e. clipping is enforced.

	No other document writes in these areas, i.e. there is no merging of
images.

Documents

A document is simply an object which will support various operations, such as
"display yourself in this viewbox." In other words, a document is a collection
of procedures and some data, called the base of the document, to which these
procedures are applied. These procedures can be specified explicitly, i.e. a
particular document might have a collection of procedures unique from all other
documents. More typically, most or all of these procedures will probably be
shared among other documents each of which are attached to a similar base. One
can think of this set of procedures as implementing a document class. Creating a
new instance of a document of a particular class then consists of specifying the
class, perhaps specifying some additional procedures or overriding existing
ones, and attaching the resulting ensemble to the base.

Note that this object-oriented approach to documents will enable the user to
invent his own documents, and provided that he follow some as yet to be
specified conventions and interfaces, these documents will then be able to be
manipulated and treated in the same way as other documents. In particular, the
documents will be able to be targets for arbitrary view boxes, and hence able to
be viewed from arbitrary other documents. Initially, we plan to implement the
following classes of documents:

(1) A (simple) text document is a document whose base is a sequence of
characters (in the future, someone will implement more general documents which
can combine both text, graphics, and view boxes). Initially, we will implement a
non-formatting text document based on Rick Cattell piece streams package, i.e.
line breaks will occur only at explicit carriage returns. (A piece stream is an
object in which characters can be inserted, removed, or retrieved.) This will be
sufficient to support typescript documents and simple editing of source files,
and therefore enable us to get off the ground. We will follow this up by
extending these documents to do filling, i.e. computing line breaks, and include
multiple fonts and faces.

(2) A string document is a document whose base is a string. It is implemented in
addition to a text document for efficiency of representation. (It is relatively
expensive to convert a string into a piece stream, and not necessary unless the
string is going to be edited.) String documents will be used for captions of
windows, keys in menus, etc. If a string document is to be edited, it will be
automatically converted into an equivalent text document.

(3) A desktop is a document whose base is a collection of possibly overlapping
viewboxes each of which views a window (see below). (A Cedar desktop corresponds
to the DLISP notion of desktop as a working surface.)

(4) A window is a document whose base is a collection viewboxes which fit
together to form a rectangle. In the typical case, this will consist of an
optional viewbox at the top which will view a string document, a viewbox in the
middle which will view an arbitrary document, and an optional viewbox at the
bottom which will view a text document with certain executable properties. We
call these three viewing areas of the window the caption, the body, and the
menu.

One can think of a window as a special type of desktop with certain geometrical
constraints. So why bother to implement it? Because we think it is a useful
document class to have, and because we want it. We do not intend to exclude
other flavors of windows, or desktops, or documents, but to provide some
convenient defaults as well as to establish a framework to which users can
incrementally add things.

Note that our definition of window differs from the DLISP notion of window, as
well as from the Smalltalk notion. We have separated two notions that were
previously combined: the rectangular viewing area in which the window appears,
and what appears inside of that area, i.e. does the window have a caption, a
menu, etc. We call the former the viewbox, and the latter, what the viewbox
views, the window. For most purposes, it will not be necessary to distinguish
between these two, the viewbox that views the window, and the window itself. In
other words, we will say that there is a window on a desktop, when what we
really mean is that there is a viewbox on a desktop which views a window.
However, this extra layer permits inclusion of windows into arbitrary documents
(i.e. inclusion of viewboxes that view windows), and also allows the user to
implement his own windows in non-standard ways, e.g. menu along the sides,
caption at bottom, more than one caption or menu, etc., as well as splitting the
body of the window into several viewing areas, i.e. viewboxes each of which view
documents.

It is important to note that the essentially top down hierarchical nature of the
desktop-window paradigm described above does not in any way preclude the user
from defining documents which do not fall into that paradigm. All that is
required is that such documents be prepared to display themselves in a specified
viewbox. How they do so is irrelevant.  For example the user could implement
documents which format themselves via a bottom-up TEX style by polling each of
their components (which might themselves be documents) and asking them how much
of the allowable viewing area they would like to have, and allocating space and
position accordingly.

Suppose the user wishes to construct complex documents whose image includes
images of other documents which are not a part of the former document, in the
sense that they may be changed without the higher document knowing about it. We
believe that it will be to the user's advantage to include these documents in
the parent document through the intermediaries of viewboxes, since this will
permit the parent document to employ already supplied facilities for rendering
and refreshing its image. In other words, if a document contains a viewbox which
views another document, and the latter document changes, the parent document
will be correctly refreshed without it having to take any explicit action.
However, if the user defines a document which views another document through a
different mechanism, then it is his responsibility to make sure that when the
latter document changes, the (various views of the) former document are
refreshed.

Viewboxes

A viewbox has dimensions of height and width. (We restrict viewboxes to be
rectangles.) It also has positioning information in terms of its home document's
coordinate system, which is interpreted by the home document (remember that the
viewbox itself is passive) and indicates where in the home document this viewbox
is to be displayed. Similarly, the viewbox has associated with it positioning
information in terms of its target document's coordinate system, which is
interpreted by the target document, and indicates what portion of the target
document is actually being viewed, i.e. what should appear in the corresponding
rectangle. These two locations are respectively called the home location, and
the target location. For example, the target location for a text document might
be the line number for the first line to be displayed and a horizontal scroll
distance, while the target location for a desktop might correspond to the
desktop coordinates for the point to appear in the lower left corner of the
viewbox.  Similarly, the home location for a viewbox that resides on a desktop
would be the coordinates of its lower left hand corner. Finally a viewbox has
associated with it scaling and rotational information, the target scale and the
target rotation, again to be interpreted by the target document.

Display Contexts

The basic (display) function of a target document is to fill a viewbox with an
image.  To do this, the target may make calls on graphics procedures to draw
characters, lines, etc. (Most of these routines have already been implemented by
John Warnock. Either these routines will be extended, or we will provide an
interface to them to support multiple clipping rectangles, and to allow swapping
bitmaps in and out of a backup file.)  These graphics routines will all take a
display context as an argument; this display context includes among other things
a pointer to a bitmap specifying where any display operation is to be performed,
a transformation (incorporating translation, rotation, and scaling) from the
target's coordinate system into bitmap coordinates, and clipping rectangles
indicating which parts of the bitmap are to be changed, i.e. are "visible".  The
display context used by a target document is always provided by the home of the
viewbox for which it is a target. The target then modifies this display context
where necessary, and then calls any documents viewed by its viewboxes to repaint
themselves, etc.

How It Works

An example of how viewboxes are used will help to clarify the above discussion.
Consider a DLISP style screen showing a desktop with several windows each
consting of a heading and a part of a text document.  Using the above
terminology, the desktop is a document with a viewbox component for each window.
The window viewboxes are looking at window documents. Each window document has
two viewbox components: one viewing a heading document and another viewing a
text document.  At the uppermost level, there is a a single viewbox, called the
ScreenViewBox or simply the Screen, which views a single window, called the
ScreenWindow, which consists of two viewboxes, one which views a text document,
(this viewbox corresponds to the socalled prompt window in DLISP), and the other
which views a desktop, called the ScreenDesktop. On the ScreenDesktop reside the
user's working windows, e.g. a typescript window, a debugging window, a program
composition window, a mail window, perhaps some stand-alone menus, etc. This
configuration is illustrated in Figure 2.

Let us see how all of this fits together by considering a total repaint of the
screen. The process begins by constructing a display context specifying as
bitmap the actual ScreenBitmap, specifying as transformation the identity
transformation, and as a clipping rectangle a rectangle with dimensions of the
screen, lower left hand corner (0,0), and then telling the ScreenWindow to
display itself in the ScreenViewBox using this display context. Our ScreenWindow
consists of two viewboxes, one viewing the PromptDocument, called the
PromptViewBox, and one viewing the ScreenDesktop. The ScreenWindow displays
itself by first modifying a copy of the display context it was given so as to
specify a clipping rectangle corresponding to the dimensions of the
PromptViewBox, and a translation transformation which takes the upper left hand
corner of the PromptViewBox into the upper left hand corner of the screen (i.e.
this takes care of the HomeLocation of the PromptViewBox), and then tells the
PromptDocument to display itself in the PromptArea using this display context.
Note that at this point the PromptDocument does not know about or care where the
viewing area is located on the bit map, or what portions of it are actually
visible, or even whether or not it is being scaled or rotated. The
PromptDocument will further modify the display context as indicated by the
TargetLocation, TargetScale, and TargetRotation, and then begin "printing" the
appropriate characters from its base. (Text documents will probably handle the
horizontal component of the target location simply by modifying the translation
transformation. Vertical component could be handled in the same way, i.e. by
adjusting the translation transformation, and then simply print the entire
document, relying on the position of the clipping rectangle to cause the right
characters to appear in the view box. However, a more efficient and probable
implementation would be to leave the vertical component of the translation
transformation alone, and instead figure out what is the first visible line in
the base and then begin printing from that point. The effect in both cases is
the same.)

When the PromptDocument finishes displaying itself, it returns control to the
ScreenWindow, which then modifies a copy of its display context to specify a
clipping rectangle corresponding to the dimensions of the viewbox that views the
ScreenDesktop, and a translation transformation which takes the lower left hand
corner of this viewbox into the lower left hand corner of the ScreenViewBox. (In
this particular configuration of the ScreenWindow, this transformation is the
identity transformation, but consider for example if the ScreenWindow also had a
menu across its bottom.) The ScreenWindow then calls the ScreenDesktop to
display itself in this viewbox using this display context.

The ScreenDesktop first paints the entire viewing area with its background
pattern, and then modifies the display context with a translation transformation
corresponding to the target location of the viewbox, i.e. where on the
ScreenDesktop the viewbox is looking, and a rotation and scaling transformation
corresponding to the target rotation and target scaling. The ScreenDesktop then
constructs display contexts for each of its viewboxes from the display context
given to the ScreenDesktop, with translation transformations and changes to the
clipping rectangle(s) corresponding to the position, i.e. home location, of the
viewbox on the home desktop. Overlapping viewboxes are also handled by
appropriately modifying the clipping rectangle(s) in the display context before
calling the target. For each viewbox, having constructed the appropriate display
context, the ScreenDesktop then calls the viewbox's target document, which is a
window document, and tells the window to repaint itself in the viewbox with the
given display context.

The window documents first paint their borders, then construct display contexts
for their headings and bodies and call them to repaint themselves, and so on.
At the lowest level, a simple text document as target just calls the graphics
routines to paint its contents.

Viewbox Dependent Formatting

At the time that a home document calls a target document telling it to display
itself in a given viewbox, the home has already modified the display context to
take into account the position of the viewbox in the home document coordinate
system. It is the target documents responsibility to modify the display context
according to the target location, scale and rotation. (There are simple
primitives Scale, Rotate, and Translate which take a display context, and a
scale, rotation, and displacement respectively and modify the display context
accordingly.) We want to make it possible for the user to implement document
classes in as simple minded and straightforward a fashion as possible. However,
for some applications, a target document might want to format itself according
to the particulars of the viewbox that views it. The most obvious formatting
would be to have the document take into account the area it has to work with,
i.e. the dimensions of the viewbox, not the dimensions of the current clipping
rectangle. For example, Figure 3 illustrates the same document being displayed
in (viewed by) two different viewboxes, A and B. Note that the visible portion
of Viewbox A, i.e. the clipping rectangle at the time that the document is
called upon to display itself, is the same as that of Viewbox B because the
latter is only partially visible in the viewbox that views the home desktop for
Viewbox A and B. We believe that what the user expects to see in the two
viewboxes is as shown in the figure.

Similarly, let us consider how a text document formats itself in the presence of
scaling. In Figure 4, Window A views a desktop on which are two windows, each of
which views a formatting text document. The window Normal (we really are talking
about the viewbox that corresponds to the body of this window) has dimensions
30x40, scale 1:1, the window Double has dimensions 60x80, scale 2:1. Let us
assume the text document is using a fixed pitch font each character of which is
10 units wide. When displaying itself in Normal, the document asks (the graphics
package) how wide is the character "n", discovers that it will fit in the
dimensions of the viewbox, displays the "n", asks how wide is the character "o",
etc., and decides to break the line after the "w." In the second case, the text
document is displaying itself in a viewbox whose dimensions are 60x80, and which
specifies a scale factor of 2:1. The text document has already modified the
display context to reflect this scale factor. Then, when it asks how wide the
character "n" is, it is told 20, not 10. The document displays the "n", the "o",
the "w", and at this point having used up 60 units of width, decides to break
the line. Thus, the document is formatted the same in both windows, i.e. the
second window simply contains a blown up version of the first, which is what was
intended.

Now let us consider what happens if the viewbox that views the desktop on which
window Normal and Double reside specifies a scale factor, as shown in Window B.
When the text document is displaying itself in window Normal, the actual
dimensions of the viewbox are 60x80, and the scale factor is 2:1, so the display
looks the same as for window Double in as it appears in Window A. When the
textdocument is displaying itself in window Double, the dimensions of the
viewbox are now 120x160, and the scaling is now 4:1. Thus when the document asks
the graphics package how wide the character "n" is, it is now told 40 units.
Thus the formatting is the same, and the display of window Double as appears in
window B is the same as window Normal in window A magnified four times.

Updating the Display

Let us consider what must happen to the display when a document is changed, e.g.
a window is moved on a desktop or a part of a text document is changed. Note
that there are two separable aspects to the refresh operation. First, we have
the problem of getting the document to update its image in the viewboxes that
immediately view it. Second, we have the problem of finding all of those places
in the display (either on the screen or in a cached bitmap) where the document
is visible along any chain of documents/viewboxes.  The document itself is
responsible for the first aspect of the update. The document can do this simply
by repainting itself in its entirety, exactly as it does with a total refresh,
even though only a part of the document has changed. Or, the document can use
the nature of the change to minimize the amount of work it has to do. For
example, if an edit has been made to a particular line of a text document, it
may only be necessary to redisplay that line. If the target location of a
viewbox has been changed, i.e. the viewbox has been scrolled, only that portion
of the new image not previously visible needs to be regenerated.

Independent of whether or not the document itself is smart about partial
refresh, i.e. whether or not it supports a partial refresh of the viewboxes that
view it in response to some small change in the document, we still have the
problem of finding all the places that these viewboxes are in turn viewed and
getting them updated. In our design considerations, we were primarily concerned
with this aspect of updating the display: with providing facilities that
efficiently handle the refresh of multiple views without greatly complicating
the documents.

A simplified description of what happens when a document changes is as follows:
the document first proceeds by considering each viewbox for which it is a
target. (A document will have as one of its attributes a list of all viewboxes
for which it is the target.) If this viewbox views any part of the affected
area, the document then obtains a list of all of the display contexts with which
that viewbox is displayed. Note that while the viewbox itself resides in only
one home document, there may be several viewboxes which view that home document,
each of which in turn may be viewed in several places, etc. What the document
needs is a display context that corresponds to the display context in effect at
the end of each chain of documents and viewboxes leading from the ScreenViewBox
down to this document, i.e. the display context has to specify the same
translation, rotation, and scaling transformations, as well as clipping
rectangles as would be in effect when the document was asked to display itself
in the given viewbox via a top-down complete refresh of the screen.

The document obtains this list of display contexts for one of the viewboxes that
view it (see definition of GetDisplayContexts below) by considering the home
document for that viewbox and then for each viewbox that views that document,
obtaining the list of display contexts for that view box, and so on until the
ScreenViewBox is reached. (Circularities are prohibited and this prohibition
enforced at the time that a viewbox is created.)  (This recursive procedure is
implemented in the function GetDisplayContexts, described in
ViewboxesInterface.Memo.) After having obtained this list of display contexts,
for each such display context, our document then simply paints its new image in
the given viewbox with that display context.

Updating the Display Efficiently

There are two ways of accelerating the updating of the display: caching the list
of display contexts for a given viewbox, so that they do not have to be
reconstructed for each update (we believe that the issue here is primarily one
of avoiding the creation and reclamation of storage, rather than saving cpu
cycles, since it would be unusual for a chain of documents and viewboxes to be
sufficiently long that the time required to ascend back to the ScreenViewbox be
significant), and caching a bitmap for a particular viewbox so that the image of
that viewbox does not have to be repainted.

Caching Display Contexts for a Viewbox

The basic idea behind caching display contexts is simple -- when a viewbox is
asked to generate a list of display contexts corresponding to the chain of
documents and viewboxes which can reach it, it checks to see if it already has
the list computed and saved in a cache. If so, it simply returns the old value.
If not, it computes the list in the usual manner and puts the result in the
cache before returning it.  This should greatly reduce the average time to
produce a list of display contexts and reduces the amount of garbage generated
by repeatedly creating and discarding the lists.

The price for this is some extra code to invalidate the cached list of display
contexts for a viewbox when something changes.  (Rather than saving information
which relates each display context in the cached list to a viewbox/document
chain and then invalidating only the particular display context affected by a
change, we have taken the simpler approach of saving just the display contexts
and invalidating the entire list when a change occurs.) Such invalidation is
necessary either (a) when the home location or dimensions of the viewbox
changes, or (b) there is a change to the viewboxes that view the home document
for this viewbox, e.g. a view box is added, deleted, or is changed with respect
to its dimensions, home location, scaling, rotation, or target location, or (c)
there is such a change to the viewboxes which view the home document for any of
these higher viewboxes, and so on, all the way back to the ScreenViewBox.

Let us consider a desktop to illustrate some common cases in which display
context caches must be discarded.  If a viewbox for which this desktop is a
target has its target location changed, i.e. the viewbox is scrolled, then the
display context caches for all viewboxes on the desktop which are visible in
this viewbox, either before or after the scroll, must be invalidated (and all
the cached display contexts for all viewboxes visible in them, if any, and so
on). If a new viewbox is created on the desktop that obscures some previously
existing ones, the cached display contexts for these viewboxes must be
invalidated (as well as the cached display contexts for the viewboxes that are
visible in any of them).  If an existing viewbox is deleted, thereby uncovering
other viewboxes, the cached display contexts for these viewboxes must be
invalidated. If the home location for one of the viewboxes on the desktop is
changed, the cached display contexts for this viewbox and the viewboxes that are
visible in it must be invalidated, as well as the cached contexts for any
viewboxes that have become covered or uncovered as a result of the move, and all
of the viewboxes visible in them, etc.

There are a variety of methods for organizing cached display contexts in order
to facilitate implementing the invalidation of these caches. These methods trade
off the complexity and amount of information to be retained that associates
viewbox/document chains with particular cached display context in order to
discard the minimal number of display contexts, against much simpler methods
which result in potentially discarding cached contexts which may still be valid.
We are currently leaning towards adopting one of the simpler methods. We require
that each document that contains any viewboxes support an operation which will
return the list of all viewboxes visible in a particular viewbox. Alternatively,
the document can simply return the list of all viewboxes that it contains, with
the result that some viewboxes will be considered when they don't have to be,
e.g. have their cached display contexts invalidated unnecessarily. The procedure
which invalidates the cached display contexts for a particular viewbox, will
then automatically invalidate the cached display contexts for all affected
viewboxes in the target document for that viewbox, and all cached display
contexts for the viewboxes that they in turn view, etc.

Caching bitmaps

We wish to allow viewboxes to keep one or more cached bitmaps to accelerate
repainting. (The same viewbox may be viewed along several viewbox/document
chains resulting in different display contexts, e.g. with different scaling or
rotation, hence the need to be able save more than one cached bitmap.)  The
decision about whether or not to cache a particular bitmap is made by the target
document, i.e. it is the target document that knows how hard it is to regenerate
the image, since it is the one that knows how to create the image in the first
place. If a particular target document decides to save the results of displaying
itself in a given viewbox with a given display context, a copy of the display
context is created that points to a cached bit map, rather than the one that
came with that context. The target document then follows its usual procedure for
repainting, following which the image is simply copied, using BitBlt, from the
cached bitmap onto the supplied bit map. Finally, the cached bitmap is stored
with the view box. (Actually both the display context and the cached bitmap are
saved, since the context is needed in order to determine when the cached bitmap
can be used, as described below.) On subsequent calls to paint the target
document, the image can be copied from the cached bitmap (provided that the
cached bitmap was generated under the same rotation and scaling transformations
as the given display context, and clipping rectangles that include, i.e. cover,
those of the given display context) without having to invoke the target
document's paint procedure at all.

The only remaining issue is that of keeping cached bitmaps valid. We deal with
this by automatically updating the cached bitmap whenever a change occurs that
affects it. This is accomplished by having the procedure which obtains a list of
all of the display contexts with which a given viewbox is displayed
automatically include any stored displayed contexts and cached bitmaps.  Thus,
whenever a target document performs a partial update, it automatically updates
the cached bitmaps for any higher viewboxes.

Note that with the above scheme, while cached bitmaps can never become invalid,
they can become irrelevant. For example, if the scaling transformation is
changed for a higher viewbox that views, through some chain of documents and
viewboxes, the viewbox for which a bitmap has been saved, this cached bitmap
still contains an accurate image, but one which is not being used in generating
the display. (When the target document was asked to paint itself in the given
viewbox with the new scale, a copy of the display context that pointed to a
cached bitmap would have been created, the painting done in this bitmap, which
would have then have been stored with the viewbox along with the cached bitmap
for the original scale.) Note that this cached bit map may become useful at some
later point, e.g. if another viewbox is created viewing the given viewbox with
the original scaling, or the view might be returned to its original scale (at
which point the second cached bitmap might become irrelevant). We plan to remove
the issue of resource allocation for cached bitmaps from the control of
individual documents, and implement some scheme for discarding irrelevant, or
infrequently used, cached bitmaps based on frequency of use, size, and amount of
storage available.


Implementation Strategy

As stated earlier, one of our primary goals has been to make implementation of
new classes of documents as simple as possible. To accomplish this, our strategy
has been to identify in the various operations that documents must provide, e.g.
display, edit, point, select, etc., those parts of the operation which can, in
principal, be the same for all classes of documents, and to factor out those
parts which need to be specialized for each particular document class. The
designer of a new document class then needs to implement only the latter
operations which are smaller and simpler. System provided procedures then can
take care of the bulk of the work, only calling on the specialized procedures
associated with the individual document to parameterize their operation. This
approach also has the benefit that it makes practical implementing system wide
strategies for resource management issues, such as caching of bit maps, display
contexts, etc., which can be made totally invisible to the client documents
provided that some portion of the corresponding document operation goes through
a system supplied interface.

For example, rather than require that each document supply a procedure which
paints the document in a given viewbox, we have defined a procedure,
PaintViewBox, which is used for all documents and viewboxes. PaintViewBox
implements those aspects of the display operation which are common to all
documents asnd viewboxes, such as obtaining the list of all display contexts for
the given viewbox so that its image is updated painted in all places that it
appears in the display, handling cached display contexts and cached bitmaps,
etc. For example, to obtain the list of display contexts for the given viewbox,
PaintViewBox ascends the chain of documents and viewboxes until either a viewbox
is encountered which has a cached list of display contexts, or until the
ScreenViewBox is reached. When these display contexts are passed back down, at
each stage, PaintViewBox must perform the corresponding translation, scaling,
and rotation transformations to the display context. However, only the document
knows how to interpret the target location, rotation, and scaling of the viewbox
that views it. Therefore, we require that each document provide an operation
called ExportDisplayContext, which modifies a display context according to the
home location of a given viewbox, and ImportDisplayContext, which modifies a
display context according to a target location, scaling and rotation, of a given
view box. PaintViewBox simply calls these procedures at the appropriate time to
parameterize its operation according to the class of document.

The details of PaintViewBox and other such common procedures as well as the
record definitions for documents, viewboxes, windows, etc., are discussed in
ViewBoxesInterface.Memo.
