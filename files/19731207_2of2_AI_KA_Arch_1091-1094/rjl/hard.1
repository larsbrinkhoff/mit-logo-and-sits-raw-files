New Hardware on the 11/45
	Recently we purchased several new hardware
devices from DEC for our 11/45. This document will
briefly decribe them. They are:
.br
.single
DC11 modem controling line interface
.br
KW11-P programmable clock
.br
DL11-B single line switchable speed interface
.br
DH11  16 line variable everything hairy interface

The DC11
	The DC11 is cabable of controlling one modem
or local EIA serial line. It has programmable character
length, and 4 program selectable speeds. It was
ordered long ago and was intended for the second 11
system that never materialized. It might be useful
if we want to connect more modems, but not very.
.ce
The KW11-P
	This is a 3 speed programable clock identical
to the one we already have. It was intended for the other
system and is essentially usless.
.ce
The DL11-B
	This is a switch selectable speed single line interface
similar to the KL11 but more flexible. It is currently wired
to drive an EIA standard line, but can be changed to drive
a current-loop (=TTY). The KL11 it replaced was the one driving
the system console. The replacement of the system console
by a TI terminal has the problem that the TI requires
nulls to be sent after carriage returns after long
(>30-40 characters) lines. LOGO and RUG have been
modified to provide these nulls, but it is next to
impossible to modify DEC's diagnostic programs to do so.
The easiiest solution to this problem seems to be to
use the Datapoint when running diagnostics; it does not
need the nulls.
	In order to accept characters from a line, both
the datapoint and the TI require a "happiness level" to
be asserted on pin 6. I have produced adapters to supply this
signal for both terminals. In the case of the TI, the adapter
is composed of 2 female conectors; the datapoint adapter is
composed of 1 male and 1 femanle. The TI hapiness level is
obtained from pin 20; the datapoint version is obtained from
pin 4. Note the in both cases the level is obtained from the
terminal itself, not from the DL11.
.ce
The DH11
	The DH11 is DEC's replacement for the older DM11
16 line multipler. In addition to correcting some disgusting
design decsions in the DM11, the DH11 provides considerably
more flexablity. The line speed, character length, number
of stop bits and other line parameters are program selectable
on a per line basis. This means that (when appropriate software
exists) we can connect any speed terminal (50, 100, 110, 134.5,
150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600 baud)
to the system. It might also allow the elimination
of some timing errors in the current DM11 software.
It also places less of a load on the Unibus than the DM11
does, making high-speed terminals more practical.

Future Hardware Mods
	Fiarly soon (hopefully) we should be getting
some modifications made to the processor by DEC to
enable us to use the parity option which Cambridge
Memories is now suppling (and which we have had on
order for some time). When this work is completed
we will be able to spot memory failures considerably
more quickly than has been possible in the past, and we
will also be able to find out if any intermitent errors
are occuring (which might result in strange behavior
of the system if undetected as now).
