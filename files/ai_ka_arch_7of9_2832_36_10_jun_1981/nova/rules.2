Design Rule Strategy and Summary

In order to relieve the designer of the need to cope with
geometric objects at a precision of 0.25m, and to produce
scalable designs, we should continue to use the lambda-based
design rules of Mead and Conway (Introduction to VLSI
Systems).  But in order to efficiently utilize the
capabilities of MEC's NSIL II and CCD processes, we must
choose lambda as small as possible and choose appropriate
mask pulling parameters to convert the designs to meet the
MEC rules (or whatever other process is available).

The MEC design rules are given in terms of final dimensions
on the wafer.  The masks are the same dimensions except for
the POL and MET layers (which use positive resist), and the
DIF layer (to account for oxide encroachment), for which
line widths are increased by 1m on the mask.  A review of
the rules has suggested the choice of l = 2m, with stretches
as indicated by the following table of micron dimensions:

	layer	drawn	mask	final	drawn	mask	final
	name	line	line	line	space	space	space

	DIF	4	6	5	6	4	5
	POL	4	4.5	3.5	4	3.5	4.5
	CUT	4	4.5	4.5	4	3.5	3.5
	MET	6	7	6	6	5	6

The other layers (IMP, BUR, and PAD) are the same size as
drawn, on mask, and final.  Using the conservative 3l DIF
spacing rule, and modified IMP rules, designs will scale
well into NSIL II.  Not all design rules are quite satisfied
with these assumptions, as discussed below.

The Icarus conventions suggested with these rules are: 0.5m
per Icarus unit (to allow some freedom for fine alignment of
45-degree lines), grid = 4 (l = 2m), tics = 16 (4l), and
typical line and flash defaults of 8 and 16 (2l and 4l).

It may be a good idea to continue to use the default Icarus
settings (l=3m) until a new Icarus is released.  We can at
least potentially change a design mechanically from the old
Icarus standard of 3m, 1l grid to the new 2m conventions
proposed above.  Accurate scaling will result if the grid is
adhered to and 45-degree items are not used (for more on
45-degree lines, see the last section of this memo).

Policy for PARC Multi-Project Chips

Future PARC MPC efforts will be run on the assumption that
contributed designs are based on the relatively
scale-independent lambda rules (with the Icarus scale
specified), so designers should not pre-bias their designs
to fit a particular set of design rules (e.g. MEC's).

MEC provides three technologies: NSIL IIA, NSIL IIB, and
CCD.  We will generally plan to run NSIL IIB, a six-mask
process with no buried contacts, unless we have a compelling
need for one of the other variations.  The double-poly CCD
process is not compatible with the NSIL IIA buried contact
process, so we will never plan to accomodate both types of
special needs on one fab run (though we could share masks).

Detailed Design Rule Discussion

The following discussion is keyed to main paragraphs of the
MEC document titled "Specification, NMOS (NSIL II) Layout
Design Rules" dated Aug. 20, 1978.  All dimensions in
microns are final, while dimensions in lambda are as drawn.

4.3.1 First Mask (DIF).  The MEC rules are 4m lines and
spaces.  The lambda-based rules of 2l lines and 3l spaces
give 5m lines and spaces, both conservative.  We insist on
the stretch to 5m lines (6m on mask) because of the
paragraph 4.3.4.3 which says a minimum transistor width is
5m to avoid degraded K'.  This stretch tends to decrease the
geometric ratio k, while the POL shrink to 3.5 tends to
increase k.

4.3.2 Second Mask (IMP).  The MEC rules for IMP overlap and
clearance have not been improved as much as the other layout
rules, because these rules do not impact the compactness of
gate designs.  They will, however, impact the compactness of
function blocks and decoders that use depletion mode
transistors.  To compromise the rules based on what we know
of the technology, to provide more compact structures, we
suggest modification of the Mead & Conway rules to change
the 1.5l overlaps and clearances to 2l and 1l along the
different dimensions, as shown is Figure 1.  This figure
compares the MEC rules and our proposed rules for a simple
function block.  It should be clear from this figure that an
alignment or lithography error of 1l will cause no problem,
while an error of up to 2l will cause increased resistance
of depletion devices or decreased resistance of enhancement
devices, but should not change the logical correctness of
the function block; this is why we expect to be able to
violate the rules as stated.  The conservative designer
should use 2l overlap and clearances wherever possible.

4.3.3 Third Mask (BUR).  Reasonable lambda-based rules for
the BUR mask layer are shown in Figure 2, compared with the
MEC rules (our rules are conservative, not optimal).  The
rules are 2l by 3l POL-DIF overlap surrounded by 1l of POL
and BUR on three sides, with no POL and 2l BUR on the DIF
side, and 2l clearance from the BUR to anything else but
MET.  Designers should not use the buried contact capability
of NSIL IIA unless their designs are severely metal-limited,
and can be improved in density by a factor large enough to
offset the yield and cost penalties of the extra mask and
processing steps.  Designers who anticipate moving their
designs into CCD, CMOS, or SOS technologies should avoid
buried contacts altogether.

4.3.4 Fourth Mask (POL).  A standard POL line width of 2l
shrinks to exactly meet the minimum 3.5m line width and
channel length of NSIL II; a space of 2l gives 4.5m, which
is conservative with respect to the rule of 3m.  Gate
overlap of 2l becomes 3.25m, conservative with respect to
the rule of 3m.  Clearance of 1l to unrelated DIF becomes
1.75m, which slightly violates the rule of 2m.  Extension of
DIF from a gate by 2l (source or drain length before
narrowing) becomes 4.75m, conservative with respect to the
rule of 4m.

4.3.5 Fifth Mask (CUT).  The minimum contact size of 2l
square exactly meets the 4.5m rule after stretching.  An
overlap of 1l of POL gives only 1.5m, violating the rule of
2m of POL surrounding the CUT (this is probably not a
problem, especially since the CUT mask is aligned directly
to the POL pattern).  A clearance of 2l to another POL or
DIF is plenty with respect to the rule of barely 2m (this is
better than a factor of 2 improvement from NSIL I, which
used 5m).  Contact hole separation of 2l results in only
3.5m, violating the rule of 4.5m (Can this matter?  MEC's
standard design rule checks do not check this rule, though
they easily could).  A contact hole over a channel is
acceptable, but may affect threhold voltage, so only use it
on the end of a pullup or in non-ratio logic such as pass
transistors.  Paragraph 4.3.5.2 of the rules shows a new
kind of contact to the DIF layer, self aligned to the field
oxide; no process other than MEC's is currently known to
support this type of contact.

4.3.6 Sixth Mask (MET).  A line width of 3l gives 6m,
conservative with respect to the rule of 5m for lines less
than 200 mils long carrying less than 5.7 mA.  A line 4l
wide meets the rules up to 500 mils long and up to 10 mA,
and should be considered a good practical standard for local
power, ground, and clocks.  A space of 3l is conservative
with respect to the 4m space rule, but violates the rule of
8m space between large metal areas (greater than 50mx50m).
MET overlap around contacts cuts is not required by the MEC
rules, but we recommend staying with 1l all around, as
naturally occurs with 4l lines.

4.3.7 Seventh Mask (PAD or OVG).  The minimum pad opening
rule is 125mx125m (same as NSIL I), which is violated by the
114mx114m openings in our library file pads.ic.  MET should
surround PAD by 10m, also violated by pads.ic, which uses
only 6m.  Clearance to unrelated circuitry should be 25m.
Use 62l pads, 5l surround, and 12l clearance for new
designs.  Preferred center to center spacing of pads is 200m
or 100l.

4.3.8 Eighth Mask (POL2).  It is probably not possible to
design CCD structures well with the lambda-based rules.  If
a double-poly design is to be run with the same mask set as
other designs, the designer should review the rules and keep
in mind the stretches being applied to the other layers.
Assume zero stretch of POL2.

Further mask layers may be used for special purposes, such
as another layer of metal for a light shield for imagers.
See the rules and talk to MEC personnel for more
information.

There is more interesting information about capacitors,
input protection, scribe lines, alignment marks, logo,
circuit name, etc., in the published rules.

Handling 45-degree Lines

Lining up the corners of lines at 45-degree corners can be
an incredible time sink in Icarus.  To avoid this problem,
one should restrict oneself to a simplified class of
diagonal lines with a single simple way of fitting the
corners together: namely, just use wires whose path points
fall on the lambda grid, and use extensions of 1m (2 Icarus
units) on the vertical or horizontal segments, and of 0.7m
(1 Icarus unit in X and one in Y) on the diagonal segments
(assuming 2l line width).  A typical corner constructed this
way is shown in Figure 3; for clarity, different layers are
used for the two segments.  Icarus does not provide an easy
way to construct corners according to this rule; it is
necessary to set the grid to 1 unit, stretch the horizontal
and vertical segments, and draw the diagonal segments to
fit.  If other line widths are needed, appropriate
extensions will have to be developed.

To test this idea, a ramcell was mechanically scaled from l
= 3 to l = 4 Icarus units (3m to 2m), resulting in the
layout shown in Figure 4.  Then the corners were fixed
according to the above rule, with the result shown in Figure
5.  It is apparent that the restriction causes no area
penalty in this case, and simplifies the layout task.
