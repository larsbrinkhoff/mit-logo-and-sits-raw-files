Talking to Sprites0

By Daniel H. Watt

(TI Logo Version)
.sp 5
.ls 1
This booklet will introduce you to sprites.  Sprites are objects - like small "robots" - that can move around rapidly with different shapes and colors on the TV screen. You can use sprites to make animated artwork or cartoons.  Eventually you will be able to invent your own TV game!

.chapter "bold(Talking to Sprites)"
.ls 2
Sprites are objects controlled by the computer, that can appear on the TV screen. There are 32 sprites, numbered from 0 to 31. When you start using the computer, all 32 sprites are invisible. They are located at the top of the TV screen with no color or shape, and with  HEADING  0  (direction of motion straight up), and  SPEED  0.  Before you can see a sprite you have to give it a shape and color and place it on the visible part of the screen.


.section "bold(Starting a Sprite)"


First, tell the computer which sprite you want to command:

	TELL   SPRITE   0      or      TELL   0

Make it carry a shape:

	CARRY   :PLANE

Give it a color:

	SETCOLOR   :RED      or      SC   :RED

Send it to the center of the screen, where it can be seen:

	HOME


Now you can make it move:

	SETSPEED   10      or      SS   10

Make it change its direction:

	SETHEADING   90      or      SH   90


.section "bold(Changing a Sprite's Properties)"


Once a sprite has started you can change its properties in several ways.


Move it to a new point on the screen:

	HOME
	SXY   10   50
	SXY   (-20)  20

Change its speed:

	SETSPEED   0
	SETSPEED   100
	SETSPEED   SPEED  +  20

Change its direction:

	RIGHT   45
	LEFT   90
	SETHEADING   150
	SETHEADING   -90
	SETHEADING   HEADING  +  30

Make it change shape:

	CARRY   :TRUCK
	CARRY   :BALL

Make it change color:

	SETCOLOR   :GREEN
	SETCOLOR   :YELLOW
	SETCOLOR   COLOR  +  1

Make it move instantly forward or back

	FORWARD   50      or      FD   50
	BACK   50         or      BK   50

.section "bold(Talking to More Than One Sprite at a Time)"


You can give commands to several sprites at once:

TELL   1			s(m)commands only sprite 1

TELL   [ 1 3 10 ]		t(m)commands sprites 1, 3, and 10 at once

TELL   :ALL			t(m)commands  all 32 sprites at once


(To type square brackets, [  and  ] , you have to type   <SHIFT> - 4  and  <SHIFT> - 5. That is, hold down the  <SHIFT>  key and the  <4>  or <5>  key at the same time.)

When you talk to more than one sprite, all commands will be directed to all the sprites at once.


.section "bold(Simple sprite activities)"


TELL   0			t(m)commands sprite 0

SETCOLOR   :RED		t(m)sets its color to the color named  "RED

CARRY   :TRUCK			t(m)tells it to carry the shape named  "TRUCK

HOME				t(m)moves it to the center of the screen

SETSPEED   10			t(m)sets its speed to 10

SETHEADING   45			t(m)makes it move at an angle of 45 degrees


Make this sprite move in another direction, with exactly the speed, shape and color you want.

Now start up a new sprite, by typing   TELL  1, for example, and give it a shape, color, location, direction and speed. Place several sprites on the screen at one time. make them all move in different directions.

Now make them all move in the same direction:

TELL   :ALL			t(m)commands all sprites

SETHEADING   90			t(m)makes them all move horizontally across the screen


To move them in different directions again, talk to them one at a time and give them each a diferent heading.


.section "bold(Pre-defined Sprite Shapes)"

.chapter "bold(Teaching the Computer a New  Command Using the Logo Procedure Editor)"
.fi b

You can teach the computer to remember a particular series of steps
by defining a procedure. When you type   TO   followed by a name that you have
chosen, the computer changes to edit mode. While you are editing, the computer does not carry out your commands, but just stores them until you finish editing. Here's what you do:
.nf l

Type   TO   followed by a name.
Type the   <ENTER>  key to clear a new line.
Then type each step in order.  
To stop using the editor, type   <SHIFT> - Z.
(Hold down the key marked   <SHIFT> and type  Z  at the same time.)

.fi b
For more information about using the editor, read booklet II - bold(Using the Logo Operating System).

.nf L
Here is an example you can try. Type

	TO   DANCE   <ENTER>

The computer will shift to edit mode.   Copy the following steps:

	TO   DANCE
	SETSPEED   10   WAIT   20
	SETSPEED  -10   WAIT   20
	RIGHT   15
	DANCE
	END

.fi b
When you have finished typing all the steps of the procedure type   <SHIFT> - Z  to return to Logo command mode. 

In Logo command mode you can use the new procedure,  DANCE as a command by typing:

	DANCE   <ENTER>

Since the last line,  DANCE,  calls the procedure procedure  DANCE  again,  the sprite or sprites you are talking to will continue to "dance"  on the screen until you stop them by typing   <SHIFT> - Z. 

To invent a procedure of your own, you can use any name that is not already a LOGO command or the name of a procedure
you have already defined.   The steps of the
procedure can be any other LOGO commands or procedures.  When you type the command  name, the computer will carry out your sequence of steps.
 

The next chapter has several sugestions for simple sprite procedures.
.bp
bold(Notes about the Logo Screen Editor)

If you want to change a procedure for any reason, type  EDIT    followed by the procedure name. This will return the computer to edit mode, with your procedure displayed on the screen ready for you to edit. When you are finished editing your procedure type:

	   <SHIFT> - Z

You can use all the special editing keys to make changes in your procedure:

bold(Commands to Move the Cursor)
 
.nf L
	<SHIFT> - 			s(m)moves cursor up one line

	<SHIFT> - 			t(m)moves cursor down one line

	<SHIFT> - 			t(m)moves cursor left one space

	<SHIFT> - 			t(m)moves the cursor right one space

	<SHIFT> - V	t(m)moves cursor to end of line.

	<SHIFT> - W	t(m)moves cursor to beginning of line.

.keep
bold(Editing Commands)

	<SHIFT> - F			t(m)erases the character at the cursor.

	<SHIFT> - T				t(m)erases the character behind the cursor,	
				t(m)just as it does when you are typing
				t(m)normal LOGO commands.

	<SHIFT> - C	t(m)erases an entire line
	t(m)to the right of the cursor.
	
	<ENTER>                     t(m)creates a new line and moves the cursor 
                                        t(m)down to the beginning of the new line.
				t(m)If there is any text to the right
				t(m)of the cursor it will be moved too.

<SHIFT> - W    <ENTER>		t(m)this combination can be used to
				t(m)create a blank line.
.end_keep
.chapter "bold(Examples of Sprite Procedures)"  
  
This procedure makes a sprite change color several times:

.nf l
	TO   CHANGECOLOR
	SETCOLOR   :RED
	WAIT   60
	SETCOLOR   :WHITE
	WAIT   60
	SETCOLOR   :GREEN
	WAIT   60
	END

.fi b
This procedure makes a sprite change color continuously:

.nf l
	TO   RAINBOW
	SETCOLOR   COLOR  +  1
	WAIT   30
	RAINBOW
	END
.fi b

Since the last line of  RAINBOW   calls the procedure  RAINBOW  all over again, it  will never stop unless you type   <SHIFT> - Z.

Here's a procedure to get a  sprite started at the center of the screen:
.nf l

	TO   STARTUP
	HOME
	CARRY   :TRUCK
	SETCOLOR   :BLUE
	SETSPEED   10
	END

.fi b
Startup will work for any sprites you are talking to.  You can use it to get several sprites on the screen at once: 

.nf l
TO   SHOWOFF
FREEZE			t(m)stops all sprites from moving
TELL   0   SETHEADING   0 t(m)each sprite is given a different heading
TELL   1   SETHEADING   15
TELL   2   SETHEADING   30
TELL   3   SETHEADING   45
TELL   [ 0  1  2  3 ]	t(m)commands four sprites at once	
STARTUP			t(m)puts them all at the center
THAW			t(m)starts them all moving again
END


This will make a moving sprite move in a circle:

TO   CIRCLE
RIGHT  10
CIRCLE
END


Now try some procedures of your own:

Make a sprite change shape several times.
Make sprites move in a square formation.
Make a procedure that will make all the sprites on the screen move in the same direction.
.fi b

Make a procedure that will make the sprites "explode". That is, go instantly to the center of the screen, move rapidly outward and then "explode" again after a few seconds.

Make a procedure to make all the sprites on the screen invisible, and stop them from moving.
.chapter "bold(Changing The Background Color)"

The command  COLORBACKGROUND  or  CB can be used to change the background color:

.nf l
	COLORBACKGROUND   :WHITE
or	CB   :WHITE

This procedure makes the background flash:

	TO   FLASH   
	COLORBACKGROUND   :WHITE
	WAIT   100
	COLORBACKGROUND   :GREEN
	WAIT   100
	COLORBACKGROUND   :CYAN
	END


This one flashes continuously:

	TO   KEEPFLASHING
	COLORBACKGROUND   :WHITE
	WAIT   100
	COLORBACKGROUND   :GREEN
	WAIT   100
	COLORBACKGROUND   :CYAN
	WAIT   100
	KEEPFLASHING
	END

This one cycles through all l6 colors:

	TO   FLASHALL  :COLOR
	COLORBACKGROUND   :COLOR
	WAIT   100
	FLASHALL   :COLOR  +  1
	END

.fi b
Before teaching this procedure to the computer you might want to read page  11  of Booklet II  bold(Using the Logo Operating System),  about editing procedures with inputs.

Some other projects to try:

Get some sprites moving on the screen. Then experiment wth different sprite colors and background colors.

Make a black background for an outer space or night scene.  

bold(Warning:  If you set the background color to  black or clear, you won't be able to see what you are typing. You can still type commands to the computer even though you can't see them.)

To restore the normal background type:

	CB   7
.chapter "bold(Making Your Own Sprite Shapes)"
There are five shapes available when Logo starts:

.nf l
Shape Name				t(n)Shape Number
:PLANE					t(m)   1
:TRUCK					t(m)   2
:ROCKET					t(m)   3
:BALL					t(m)   4
:BOX					t(m)   5

You can make your own shapes using the command   MAKESHAPE  or  MS.  At any one time you can create up to 28 shapes, numbered from 0 to 27.  If you choose the number of an existing shape, that shape will be displayed on a 16 by 16 grid.  If no prior shape exists, the grid will be blank.

	MAKESHAPE   1			t(m)MAKESHAPE   6
.sp 12
Draw your shape by using the arrow keys to move the shape cursor. If you hold the  <SHIFT>  key down, the cursor will leave a colored square behind when it moves.  With the   <SHIFT>   key up,  the cursor will leave a blank square when it moves.

To clear the entire shape so that you can start over, type   <SHIFT> - C.
When the shape is finished, type   <SHIFT> - Z.

Tell a sprite to carry the new shape:

	TELL   0   CARRY   6
	SETCOLOR   :BLUE
	HOME

You can give the shape a name if you want to:

	MAKE   "NEWSHAPE   6		t(m)and then you can type

	TELL   1   CARRY   :NEWSHAPE

If you want to see what a new shape will look like while you are drawing it, tell a sprite to carry it before you make the shape. Then put the sprite over on the right side of the screen so you can see it while you draw it:

.nf l
	TELL   2   CARRY   7		t(m)shape  7  does not yet exist
	SETSPEED   0
	SETCOLOR   :BLACK
	SXY   20   20
	MAKESHAPE   7

.fi b
As you draw the shape on the drawing pad, it will appear on the sprite at the same time.
.chapter "bold(Making Movies - A Sprite Animation Project)"
A simple animated movie can be made by having a sprite carry two different shapes, one after another. This example shows how you could animate a "flying bird."  First, you need to design to shapes to represent two wing positions:

	MAKESHAPE   10			t(m)MAKESHAPE   11
.sp 12
Now give names to both shapes:

MAKE   "WINGUP   10		MAKE   "WINGDOWN   11

These commands make the names   "WINGUP   and   "WINGDOWN   stand for the numbers 10 and 11.  The command   CARRY   :WINGUP   will have the same effect as the command   CARRY   10.  When you write a procedure, the names make it easier to understand  what the procedure is doing.  This procedure will make the sprite look like a flying bird:

.nf l
	TO FLY   :T
	CARRY   :WINGUP
	WAIT   :T
	CARRY   :WINGDOWN
	WAIT   :T
	FLY   :T
	END

Now give a sprite a speed, heading and color and tell it to  "fly:"

	TELL   1
	SETSPEED   20
	SETHEADING   75
	SETCOLOR   :BLACK
	FLY   20

Explore the effect of different inputs to fly:

	FLY   30   FLY   5   FLY   100

.fi b
You might want to make a more "realistic" movie by having more than two wing positions.  You could do this by making some more wing shapes between  "up" and "down."

Tell several sprites to fly at the same time. Each one needs to have a speed heading and color first:

.nf l
TELL   2   SETSPEED   10   SETHEADING   20
TELL   3   SETSPEED   15   SETHEADING   30
TELL   4   SETSPEED   20   SETHEADING   40

TELL   [ 2 3 4 ]   SETCOLOR   :BLACK    FLY   20
