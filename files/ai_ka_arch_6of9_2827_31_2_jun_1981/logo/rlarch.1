%%%%%We have provided here an example of the educational use of computers that goes beyond drill-and-practice and game-playing to the adoption of an idea of great generality.  The incremental change of an isolated variable, variable stepping, is a heuristic, a useful method for exploring a new domain of experience.  We will now ask "From what sort of cognitive structure comes the behavior we describe as the application of a heuristic^?" and "What led to its salience in Robby's later problem solving ?"  The empirical evidence is too anecdotal and highly interpreted to be coercive; we intend here no more than a plausible conjecture.  The basic position I want to advance is that specific characteristics of Robby's experience permitted him to see the construction of shape families as sensible and further that they also account for the salience of the way of seeing problems we describe by the verbally formulated heuristic: "isolate a variable; change it a step at a time".

%%%%%I describe in  other places (Lawler, 1979 and 1980b) cognitive structures called MICROWORLDS.  For our purposes here we can think of microworlds as what is constructed in the mind in consequence of the individual's activity in a specific domain of experience under the influence of prior, ANCESTRAL, microworlds.  Microworlds are of two parts: PERSPECTIVES specify "What's what", i.e. what the mind can appreciate as the significant elements in the experience; FUNCTIONS are the transformations that can happen to those elements which  the perspective specifies as significant.  The functions may be represented as procedures or as well-known-results (compiled procedures).  Which of the three kinds of knowledge is most significant ?  I believe that perspectives are.   While I admit, for example, that it is worthwhile to memorize "addition facts" and useful to develop procedures of mental calculation,  I hold it is more significant to appreciate the role of place value in the hindu-arabic representation of number.  (None of these aspects of knowledge can develop independently of the others, however.) The perspective is one's window-on-the-world; it specifies the terms in which one can try to make sense of experience.

%%%%%Microworlds, as described so far, are rooted in specific experience domains.  But other kinds of microworlds, of similar structure but somewhat different function, are important in the organization of mind.  One type, control microworlds, function in solving problems by invoking others.  (The functions of such microworlds are limited to the routing of perspective element values to subordinated worlds.)  A second type, mapping worlds, has no functions at all: such a perspective comprises correspondences between the perspective elements of other microworlds.  The third type of microworld, special in character but not so in structure or function, as such, is the archetype.  What is special about the archetypical microworld is locality of reference.  What does this mean ?  In general, microworlds are able to invoke the knowledge of ancestral worlds from which they have descended.  LOCALITY OF REFERENCE means a microworlds can be an archetype if (among other things) functions are constrained to intra-world transformations.  The "other things" include: direct connection of perspective elements to ancient knowledge for their initial complete definition; crisp distinction between microworld elements so that their discriminating assignment is uncomplicated; a regular correlation between specific operand elements and the operations performable on them.  Under these constraints, prediction (stepwise speculation) can proceed with inference chains of minimal length, i.e. minimal inference implies that from "what's what" "what follows" in "intuitively obvious".  In such a case, the logic of the world is "necessary" and involves no invocation of any subordinate structures.  The claim then is that turtle geometry, as represented by Robby's POLYSPI FAMILIES experiences, fulfills the characteristics necessary to produce an archetypical microworld.  If a new relationship is perceived between the elements of an archetypical microworld, this is especially significant because the archetype can function as a new seed of genesis for future experience-based microworlds.  The virtue of locality of reference is in establishing a new plateau of thought, a new level of cognitive primitives, in this case, variable stepping.


%%%%%My conjecture is that the characteristics of the POLYSPI experience justify the claim of archetypical status for the microworld constructed in Robby's mind: in general, the experience of turtle geometry is accesssible to children because they can simulate with their own body-knowledge of movement the actions which the turtle performs; the crisp distinction between linear distance and a rotation is clear; the regular coupling of moving with linear distance and rotation with turning is  also clear.  What is further significant is that within this archetyypical world, Robby could appreciate a new method for making sense of complex interactions.  What we see as a "heuristic" is a new level of thought a-borning.  The power of the idea is that stepping variables is, in fact, a very useful way to explore our common world.  What gave it salience in Robby's mind was its exemplification in an experience domain both so concrete and simple that from it he could construct an archetypical microworld.  The POLYSPI SHAPE FAMILY microworld is genetically the ancestor of the structure (either ephemeral or permanent) derived from Robby's play with the paper rings puzzle.  To the extent that other microworlds, similar to the later, will in the future derive directly from the archetypical POLYSPI SHAPE FAMILY world, that microworld will serve as the nucleus of a cluster of worlds developed from "seeing" the world as comprehensible through the stepping of variables.


  There remains the question of how, precisely, Robby's explorations with variable stepping relate to that more constrained activity. hypothesis testing, which I take to be the sine qua non of the Genevan separation of variables.

%%%%%My suggestion is that this sort of systematic exploration is a typical precursor of the hypothesis-driven experimentation which Genevan psychologists argue is the sine qua non of formal operational thought.  How could that be true, given the argued vagueness of Robby's purpose ?  Isn't the key idea, the criterion hypothesis testing, not the mere classification of results discovered by trial and error^?
