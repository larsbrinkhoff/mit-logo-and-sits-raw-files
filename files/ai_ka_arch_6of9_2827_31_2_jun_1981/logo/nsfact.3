Here is a sample, "Computer play for people," using the script and actor
metaphor, to provide a model of the system's functioning.  It's obviously
too cumbersome to expect a child to read.  Andy suggests we might film this
and several other types of situations, and make these films part of the 
curriculum materials.  (It could be filmed with kids in Brookline or
Lamplighter for example.)

Alternatively, or in addition, we could make this part of the teacher material,
with the idea that a teacher could read it to understand how he/she could talk
about this stuff with children.  The teacher could also act it out with a
class.  Each kid only needs to learn a few rules.  If the kids learn the rules,
only the USER really needs a "script" in order for the "play" to happen.  Once the
rules are learned, lots of new scripts can be invented for different situations,
and the teacher could get the class to act them out, in order to introduce a new
command or debug a particular procedure, etc.  Also we could simplify it to make it
more readable by a kid.  Any suggestions?

A computer "play" for people

At this point it might be useful to stop and think a little bit about how the
computer really makes these wonderful things happen.  We will consider a very simple
example:  Drawing a square, defining and running a procedure SQUARE, and defining
and running a procedure, WINDOW, which uses SQUARE as a subprocedure.

Introducing a cast of characters:

The computer user:  a real person...you
The computer manager: "the part of the computer that keeps track
  of what's happening"
A group of unemployed actors (who can play any roles given them)

A group of special purpose ("one line") actors who can only do one thing; these are
LOGO commands, and we'll be meeting more of them as we go along.  And a very special
actor, the Turtle, who is a mindless robot under the control of certain special actors,
usually the FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT, and LEFT actors, as well as a few others.

A set of blank name tags and envelopes for the actors setting the stage.  You will
need to divide the class into roles:  The Turtle, stands in the center of a bare stage.

Several FORWARD actors; each FORWARD actor carries an envelope on which the words 
how many steps are written.

Several RIGHT and LEFT actors; each RIGHT and LEFT actor carries an envelope on which
the words how many degrees? are written.

A TO actor; This actor has a pad for taking notes.

an END actor;

The rest of the class can be unemployed actors waiting for scripts.

All the actors can be seated in rows, with actors of the same type.  The computer
manager sits at a table with several empty chairs next to it.  At the table is a box
marked "scripts".  The box is empty.  The computer manager also has a list of special
actors.

Through the play, the user talks only to the computer manager; the computer manager talks
only to one actor at a time.  Each actor talks for only one other actor at a time.

ACT I - MAKING THE TURTLE MOVE IN A SQUARE

The user has decided to have the turtle draw a square.  He or she speaks to the
compuer manager.

CM:  What do you want me to now?

USER: SQUARE

(CM looks through list of special actors and does not find SQUARE.  Looks through
box of scripts -- it is empty)

CM: You haven't told me how to SQUARE
What do you want me to do now?

USER: Forward 10

CM: Finds FORWARD on the list.  Calls out FORWARD

(The first FORWARD worker gets up and comes up the desk.  CM puts a card with the
number 10 in its envelope.  All the other forward actors move up one seat.)

Forward:  (reaches into envelope, pulls out card and speaks to the Turtle:)  go
FORWARD 10 steps. (The turtle moves forward 10 steps)  Seeing this, the FORWARD actor puts 
the 10 back in the card box and sits down in the empty chair.  Once forward has sat down...

CM: (to user), what do you want me to do now?

USER:  RIGHT 90

CM: (finds RIGHT on list; calls) RIGHT (Manager puts the card 90 in RIGHT's envelope)

RIGHT: (to Turtle) Turn right 90 degrees.  Turtle turns, RIGHT put's card back and sits
down.)

CM: (to user) what do you want me to do now?

USER: FORWARD 10

CM: (to a new FORWARD actor) FORWARD (hands FORWARD a 10)

FORWARD: (to turtle) go forward 10 steps

(Turtle omves forward 10 steps, FORWARD puts card back and sits down)

CM: What do you want me to do now?
