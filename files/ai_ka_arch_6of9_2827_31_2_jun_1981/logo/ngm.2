0.  GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS of SCREEN

graphics,text (and edit) modes:
      screen (tv on side) 24 wide by 32
      graphics top 24 by 24
      logo bottom 8 by 24

this screen can be filled with designs in colors,
and have parts which move.  

1. MOTION and COLOR

the moving/life forms in this world are turtles.
you can make one appear by
    TURTLE 1

You can call it by a pet name 
    CALL TURTLE 1 "LADYBUG          (not quite correct)

and you can make it move:
    GO 8                  (turtle moves forward at a speed of 8)

you can make another turtle chase the first turtle.
    TURTLE 2
    GO 1          

    STOP
stops all turtles and
    START
does the obvious.

You can change the shell of the turtle (what it looks like on the screen)
    CARRY :FLOWER

will make the turtle look like the shell named FLOWER.

1a. COLOR

Change the color of a turtle by saying:
   COLOR :LADYBUG RED         ( RED is builtin. )

Change the color of a logo object by
   COLOR <object> <color or list of colors>

tiles take either <color> (set fg only) or <list of colors> set
fg, bg colors.

turtles take only one color.

COLORQ <logo object> returns the color or list of colors of an object.

you can rename colors if you like
    CALL RED "SUNSET
    COLOR :SUN :SUNSET

2. PATTERNS,TILES and SHELLS

    CALL SHELL 1 "LADYBUG
this program makes the ladybug shell look like a
checkerboard:
   DO UNTIL X>8
   [FILL :LADYBUG [X Y]        FILL is a pattern command.  it takes
   CALL "X :X+2                a tile/shell and fills in that dotspot.
   CALL "Y :Y+2]

to take out one of the dots,
   BLANK :LADYBUG [X Y]

You also can use your terminal keyboard to design patterns, 
   PATTERN :LADYBUG
 and you are in largescale pattern design mode.
(grid appears, walk turtle around using keeze to make a design.)

Patterns can also be assigned to tiles: in which case
   CALL
