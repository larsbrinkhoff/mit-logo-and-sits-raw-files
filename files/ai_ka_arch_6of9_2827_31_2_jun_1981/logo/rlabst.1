TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT TIC-TAC-TOE [1]

     The Boston Children's Museum offers it visitors unlimited access
to a computer facility on which many games are encoded.  One of the games 
is Tic-tac-toe, and visitors freely choose to play that game.  If such 
a game were implemented on a computer at Logo how would it be different
from what the Children's Museum offers ?

     When a game starts on the Museum computer, the user is asked 
to chose either noughts or crosses as his markers, to choose whether
he or the computer should have first move, and to choose the location
of his markers in turn.  The representation by which he specifies his
moves is based on this grid:

2
                1 | 2 | 3 
               -----------
                4 | 5 | 6 
               -----------
                7 | 8 | 9

0When, in his turn, the user selects and specifies a number, his marker
replaces the digit in the appropriate cell.  He is informed of which cell
the computer has selected in its turn.  The outcome of play is usually
a tie or computer victory, although a knowledgable user can win.  The
computer appears to follow a procedure which specifies actions in this
order:

     1. win if possible.
     2. make any forced moves.
     3. avoid well known pitfalls.
     4. select the highest valued empty cell (center first, corner next,
          side last choice).
.adjust
Users play a game or two and are dismissed by the computer message that
it's time for another child to have a turn.  

     The issues around which a Logo alternate presentation would coalesce
are representation, systematicity and the articulation of complementary roles.
Representation is more than a coding convenience; it is how you are able
to see what's important.  Contrast the noughts-and-crosses representation
of the game below with an alternate representation for three different
games which reduce to the same pattern of noughts-and-crosses:
.nofill
.ss
2          X | X | X      C | D | B       A | D | C      B | D | C 
     -----------    -----------     -----------    -----------
      O | X |        b | A |         a | B |        a | A |  
     -----------    -----------     -----------    -----------
      O |   | O      a |   | c       c |   | b      c |   | b 
.adjust

.ds
0The second (alphabetic) representation preserves the sequence of moves -
an essential class of information for any user's analysis of how a victory
was effected or  defeat  suffered.

     A systematic description of the configuration of the first two moves
possible in games leads to a surprising discovery.  Given rotational invariance,
only twelve different forms of games are possible.  Of those twelve configurations
of opening moves, seven permit an expert first player to win directly; others
permit traps to be set for the unwary opponent.  Further, five of the twelve games
are rarely encountered, so that what is required for practical mastery of
Tic-tac-toe is a very compact body of knowledge.  (See Figure I-1).

     An analysis of the twelve opening configurations and their relation
to forks shows that the crucial move in expert play is the first player's
second move.  The expert will use this move to force his opponent's subsequent
move to a cell which will not interfere with his linkage of two "chances-to-win"
into a fork by his third move.  The logic of the expert turns the "forced moves"
of defensive play to offensive use by actively controlling interaction with
the opponent.

     What could a child derive from a game so formulated ?  Access to and
comprehension of expert play can provide a vision of the power of knowledge
in a domain of the child's own experience and his own social world.  This
formulation focusses on the central roles of representation and systematicity
of thought in the power of knowledge.  The expert's logic, wherein he controls
the opponent's moves, can show how critical is direct consideration of the
other actors to reaching goals in any activity with complementary roles. 

     The general conclusion to be drawn is that these features of an intellectually
deep game formulation derive from Logo's long engagement with the issues of
Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Epistemology.  What Knute Rockney said
matters of football is true of computer ames as well:

0NOTES: if the opponent move where a dash is shown, he can be forked.
    the first player's second move (B) must prevent the opponent's
       second move (b) from interfering with the link (C) which
       creates the fork.
