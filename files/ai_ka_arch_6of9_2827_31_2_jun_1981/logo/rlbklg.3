^^^^^^^^^^The value of this collection is as an extension and supplement to Papert's recent book, Mindstorms: Computers, Children, and Powerful Ideas.  The audiemce to be addressed is Papert's audience -- especially those who would appreciate more concrete detail and a sense of where to go next.  Given that these essays are a collection, some may contain more technical material than would have been appropriate to Mindstorms.  Further, I expect such a book to be used in college courses where future teachers will have a hands-on opportunity to design and develop computer applications for children.  The purpose of the book is to focus the design of computer applications for children on powerful ideas instead of basic skills.

.ls 1Justification and the issue of closure:
^^why present a collection of papers now rather than later or previously ?
^^1. project termination as justification....I see no such termination,
^^^^^though a metamorphosis, even a taking wing, might be a possibility.
^^2. much better: a new plateau in clarity from the establishment of microworlds
^^^^^as an engineering task for the education industry; the review of how this 
^^^^^idea developed is a way to exemplify the idea itself -- the best way.
^^3. who would do the work ?  how would the book take shape ?
^^^^^a. I would function as editor and as factor; this would involve my
^^^^^^^^writing an introduction, selecting (with consultation) papers from
^^^^^^^^the Logo archives (however limited they in fact are), requesting
^^^^^^^^revisions (minimal) and coping with a publisher.  The purposes of
^^^^^^^^the introduction (with the title The Architecture of Interior Space)
^^^^^^^^would be to relate the various papers through the idea of microworlds and
^^^^^^^^to present through the papers a more detailed, albeit more primitive,
^^^^^^^^exposition of Logo ideas than Mindstorms.
^^^^^b. a typist would key current memo texts with emacs/R control characters;
^^^^^^^^to the extent any texts are online now, keying effort and expense could
^^^^^^^^be saved.  These texts would go to their authors, along with a copy of
^^^^^^^^the introduction.
^^^^^c. each article author would be expected to make any quality improvements
^^^^^^^^he chooses of limited scope (in light of the collection having a
^^^^^^^^historical as wellas programmatic focus).  Criticism of the introduction
^^^^^^^^would be solicited from each article author -- the reasons for this are to
^^^^^^^^make sure the introduction is as fair as possible and to draw on the better
^^^^^^^^ideas of others in this community.
^^4. prospective contents:
