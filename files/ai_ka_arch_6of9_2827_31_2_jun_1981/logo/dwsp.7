Since I don't know when I'll be seeing you, and Greg says you'll be in town this weekend, I thought I would write this note to tell you my plans with regard to the NSF project. My time here will technically be over by the end of June, and most of what I plan to complete should be finished by then. I will be spending part of the summer finishing up any loose ends. I plan  to complete six booklets, each with two versions, to be compatable with Apple and TI versions of LOGO. Two other booklets could be included if desired. 

I'm not sure what should be done about publishing these. I would like to make these draft versions available as Logo memos (so that people can use them for trial teaching) while sending them around to publishers in accordance with a publication plan suitable for NSF. (Perhaps TI would be a logical publisher for the TI versions.) I do think they will be useful to kids and teachers, and hence should be available, whether "published" or not.

Here is the outline of the six booklets that should make up the set:

1. Introduction:
.in 5
Background information about Logo;
Ideas about how to use the booklets;
Some general comments on learning and teaching Logo;
.in 0

2. Using the Logo operating system:
.in 5
using the keyboard
using the Logo Screen Editor
saving procedures (shapes,etc) on disk and cassette
information about screen modes

.in 0
3. Talking to the Turtle (Introductory Turtle Geometry)
.in 5
basic turtle commands
teaching the computer new commands
using the turtle's pen  (pen and background colors)
Drawing designs with circles and arcs
Using subprocedures
Repeating Designs (REPEAT and recursion)
.in 0

4.  Further explorations with turtle geometry
.in 5
procedures with inputs
procedures with changing inputs and stop rules 
explorations with poly, polyspi and inspi
.in 0

5. Games with a dynamic turtle
.in 5
what is a dynamic turtle
a dynaturtle target game
a racetrack game
a lunar lander game
.in 0

(each section includes a description of how the game is played, helpful hints for people who are having trouble, challenges for successful players)

6. How  dynaturtle procedures Work

Optional Booklets:   These booklets are basically available and could be considered part of this set  (deliverables to NSF) if you want them to be.

7. Talking to Sprites
.in 5
introduction to sprite graphics based on work I did last year.
.in 0

8. A "structured" introduction to Logo and Turtle Geometry.
.fi b

(This booklet is something I am doing separately for Brookline, at their request.  This covers generally the same material as booklet three, but in a different format.  It is structured as a set of lesson ideas for teachers and activity sheets for kids.

9. Bob Lawler's idea sheets.  In my opinion these are an excellent set of ideas, but written in a way that makes them inaccessible to most kids and teachers. Nonetheless, they could be included in this package, and might be useful to some readers.

10. At one point you suggested that the book that you and John were working on might technically be considered part of the NSF package, as well as a TI owned product. If possible, this would add to the "weight" of what is being completed for NSF. I think it's appropriate because John was employed by the NSF grant last year.  I don't know whether this is feasible, considering all the misunderstandings we've had with TI, but they might not object if they could also obtain publication rights to NSF booklets which they did not pay for.


There should probably be a booklet of ideas for activities with words - but I won't have time to do one within this time frame. Biology ideas are also missing. It might be possible to write up some of the ideas we used last year, but I don't feel that they were very effective with the students at that time.

For the record, I would like to state some of the difficulties under which I have been laboring while carrying out the project this year.

Little or no typing help (especially since Pearl left). This wasn't Greg's fault. There simply wasn't time.

Competition for terminal time and microcomputer time with programmers. Again, nobody's fault, just not enough resources to do what was needed comfortably.

No printer for the Apple or TI micros. this slowed development of programs, printing of illustrations, etc.

No current version TI system (for much of the year older version TI systems did not work properly.) The breakdown in communication between TI and this lab made any ongoing curriculum work using TI systems extremely difficult.

Much time and discussion spent supporting Hal in his effort to get Apple Logo out, talk to publishers, discuss legal issues, etc.

Little coordination of efforts in connection with this project. (Andy has helped with ideas relating to dynaturtle stuff.) There must have been other people paid by this project, but there did not seem to be anyone sharing this particular effort.

Equipment delays in Brookline - Their Apples not arriving until almost Thanksgiving. Also extreme demoralization in Brookline due to Prop. 2-1/2. (Why that should have effected this work is unclear, but since Brookline is being cut extremely heavily, it effects everything happening there - made it more difficult to try things out in classes, etc.)

Despite difficulties, I'm satisfied that the booklets will be useful to many people, and that along with Apple Logo and with the publication of the "mini-Logo" program that Patrick wrote, we will have satisfied our obligations to the NSF.

I would appreciate your comments on this memo and the acompanying draft materials. The booklet on How Dynaturtle Procedures Work is the newest, and has had least revisions and is still incomplete. The introductory booklet, and the further explorations in turtle geometry boklet exist in notes, but not yet in drafts. 

I will consider no comment from you at this point to mean at least general aproval of this memo and the materials. Obviously, minor editing can occur later.
