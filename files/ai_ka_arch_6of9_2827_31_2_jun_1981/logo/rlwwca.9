^^^^^^^^^^We present an extensive and coherent vision of the development of the ability to compose natural language text and propose creating facilities to support such a path of learning. This document is comprised of three distinct but related papers: The^Unreachable^Word (Word Worlds for pre-schoolers); Precursors^to^Composition (for pre-adolescents); A^Computer^Writing-Workshop (for composition students of any age).

1From a Mathland to Word Worlds0

^^^^^^^^^^The central problem of humane education is how to instruct while respecting the self-constructive character of mind.  During the past decade, the M.I.T. Logo Project has made significant contributions to resolving this problem.  This is  most clearly true in domains of mathematical focus.  Advancing technology (See Miller, 1979; Fox et al., 1980) and theoretical clarifications (See Papert, 1980 and Lawler, 1981a, 1981b) encourage us to extend  our best results to domains now within reach.  We believe Logo ideas can be exported coherently from the "mathland" of the past to the world of language.

1Microworlds and Education0

^^^^^^^^^^The Logo Project has defined a new engineering task for the education industry, the design of microworlds.  These virtual  environments for the learning of domain-specific knowledge are made possible by computers  and typically involve the reconceptualization of an intellectual domain in such a way as to permit its connection with knowledge the learner can be expected to bring to the experience.  The premier example is the design of turtle geometry so that even young children can interpret mathematical experiences in terms of their own actions in moving through space (Papert, l980).

An Example.^^^^^^^^^^The specific virtue of a microworld is in the uncluttered presentation of a powerful idea.  Consider this simplest Logo computer application for very young children.  From that age, usually about two years, when they first begin to enjoy playing with blocks, children delight in building towers and even more in destroying them.  We have introduced toddlers to the FLOOR TURTLE, an electromechanical robot that can move forward and back and can turn right and left under  computer control.  Young children have frequently built towers and driven the turtle into them to bring them crashing down.  The child's first "destroyer" is her own hand or foot; next comes a hand held toy; later the child may verbally command a toy to knock down the tower, then move it into action herself.  Why is the latter activity especially significant in a Logo environment ?  The child is at that pass in development where a simple, symbolically mediated system can be mastered.  When she pushes a button that means forward and the turtle moves, she has entered a new virtual world of experience, one whose simple operations are as dependable as gravity but one more obviously controlled by symbol manipulation than by physical interactions.  The child, seeing where the turtle goes, making corrections to achieve a specific objective, is in a feedback loop, having a "hands-on" experience of INFORMATION-AS-CONTROL akin to that of an engineer.  Like gravity, the turtle can not be bullied but must be understood to be mastered.  This toddler's symbolic microworld demands precision of control and correctness of order in commands.  Unlike the "real world" with its various dangers, the blocks world of the floor turtle is essentially forgiving -- the operations are reversible at little cost and very little is at risk.  But the limits of this world are limits of simplicity, not limitations of potential.  The world of the floor turtle is compatible in detail with sophisticated worlds of computer generated designs, where simple procedures can produce patterns of striking beauty.

^^^^^^^^^In the following discussions, we examine how to develop a  Logo system infra-structure for a range of word worlds.  We look towards a Logo language subset for controlling and accessing a video-disk and another for communicating with other microprocessors and a central storage processor.  Further, we discuss a series of diverse but Logo-compatible subsystems.  These subsystems will be tools for activities in word microworlds spanning a range from some worlds specifically for pre-readers to others useful to adults.

^^^^^^^^^^Microworlds address the central problem of education by creating intellectual spaces wherein the learner can act, through which action she will progressively construct within her mind cognitive structures embodying the relations among elements of the microworld domain.  The exploration of these virtual worlds is a better experience than "getting teached" because, while the learner builds upon what's in her mind, the virtual world shapes her new knowledge to the powerful ideas achieved by the culture and embodied in the microworld.  This idea forms the core of our Logo Project attempt to address the learning of the alphabetic language.  In the following descriptions of microworlds, first pre-schoolers are our focus (The Unreachable Word), then students of grammar school age (Precursors to Composition).  Finally, we examine composition and its development in a computer culture of more mature students (A Computer Writing-Workshop).
