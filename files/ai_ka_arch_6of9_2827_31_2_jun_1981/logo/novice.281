A Novice's Guide to Using the 
.ce
General Turtle 3500 LOGO System

This is a draft of a guide for teachers about how to use the 3500
LOGO system.  It assumes that the reader knows nothing about computers,
and only a little bit about LOGO.  It is intended to tell the reader
HOW TO DO CERTAIN THINGS that occasionally have to be done, to keep the
computer system operating, to initialize and copy disks, to create
directories for new users, to erase unneeded files, and occasionally,
to solve problems that occur when files get accidentally messed up.

The reader is not expected to "understand" what s/he is doing in all
cases.  S/he should simply be able to follow directions accurately.  In
all cases, things that you are supposed to type will be indicated by an
arrow (@@@@@).  Things that the computer might type will be indicated
by single quotes (for example, `Welcome to LOGO').  The instruction to
type a carriage return (green button) is given by a curved arrow (@@@@).

The writer encourages feedback of all kinds.  We particularly want to
know whether we have given the reader adequate information.  Are the
instructions clear?  Are there situations which we have missed?  Are
the explanations too long or too brief.  We need your help to
make these instructions more useful to you and to other teachers, who
may use them in the future.

HOW TO START THE COMPUTER
.indent 3
.undent 3
1.  Connect all the wires in the appropriate places.  Each wire can
only be plugged in where it belongs.  Be extremely careful not to
force any connector in a place where it might not fit.  (This can be a
problem with the flat disk connectors.)  If you are not sure about what
to do, ask for help from someone who has done it before.

.undent 3
2. Plug in the power cords.

.undent 3
3. If your computer has an on-off switch, press the "on" button.

.undent 3
4. Place a LOGO disk in the top slot of the disk reader.

.undent 3
5. Press the reset button on the LSI-11.  The computer should respond
by asking for the time and date.  You can ignore that request by typing
@@@@.  `Welcome to LOGO...' should appear on the text display screen.

How to Handle 3500 Systems Crashes

There are two types of crashes:  LSI-11 crashes and 2500 crashes.
(The 2500 is the computer that runs the display terminal.)

A) LSI-11 crashes:
.br
(1) The LOGO@@?@@goes away; a six digit number appears, followed by an@@@@symbol:
.br
`000020'
.br
`@@@'
.br
When this happens, remove the disk that is in the top slot of the disk
reader, and replace it with a LOGO disk.  Then type: @@@@@173000G
.br
(The G is typed using the shift key.  Do not type carriage return.)
.br
After typing 173000G the disk lights should flash on and off,
while emitting low clicking sounds.  This means that the computer is
reading the instructions for LOGO from the disk.  When it is finished,
the computer should present you with a message asking for the date and
time.  You may disregard this, and type a carriage return.  `Welcome to
LOGO' should appear.

Sometimes you will have to repeat this process once or twice before it
works.

(2).  Alternatively, put a LOGO disk in the top slot, and press the
reset button on the LSI-11.  This should bring the date and time
message, followed by `Welcome to LOGO'.

(3). Sometimes the system gets "hung up" to the point where it does not
respond to the keyboard.  It may be possible to save the workspace in such
a case:  push the HALT button on the LSI-11.  Then type@@@300G 
.br
(shift key for G -- no carriage return.)  This may bring
back everything in your workspace.  If not, remove the disk; put a
LOGO disk in the top slot, and use method 2 above.

(4). If none of these methods works, turn off the computer for a few
minutes.  Check to see that all the connections are secure.  Then plug
in the computer again, turn it on and try again.  If the computer still
does not load LOGO properly, try another LOGO disk.  If that doesn't
work, ask for further help.

(5). Once LOGO is reloaded, and the computer has printed the `Welcome
to LOGO' message, you may remove the LOGO disk, and replace the user's
disk in the top slot.  The user will have to LOGIN again.  Any new
procedures that had not been saved before the crash will have been lost.

.block 5
B) 2500 Crashes -- Display Crashes:
.br
This sometimes happens when there is a big messy repeating design on
the screen, or sometimes during animations.  Both screens go blank, and
there is no reaction to the keyboard.  Push the reset button on the
2500.  Then you should get a ? Type CS and go on from
there.  The work-space should not be affected.

.block 5
C) LOOSE WIRES
.br
Sometimes the system appears to crash because one or more wires
jiggled loose.  If the above methods fail, or if the screen suddenly
goes dark for no apparent reason, check all connections, and try
methods under A) or B) again.  This often works.

.block 5
D) OVERHEATING
.br
The system has been known to "act funny" when overheated.  One symptom
is a repeated beeping sound.  Another is a failure to load LOGO
properly.  The system has to be turned off for a while to cool off.
Check the cooling fans to make sure they are working.  If the air
filters for the fans are clogged with dust they should be cleaned.

HOW TO CREATE A NEW USER INDEX

1. In order to carry out these activities you must have a "teacher
disk".  Place your teacher disk in the bottom slot of the disk reader,
(slot 1) and type:
.br
READ [1; USERS STARTING CREATE]

2. Put the disk you want to add a new user index to in the top slot of
the diskreader (slot 0).

3. If you have just initialized the disk*, and want to create several
new user indices at once, type
.br
SETUP  [JOHNNY  ALICE  MARY  ...]
.br
where JOHNNY, ALICE, MARY, ... are the names of the children who will
use the disk.

Then wait for the computer to process all the indices.  You will see
stuff printed out on the screen.  When the computer is finished setting
up the indices it will print the statement:
.br
`FINISHED'
.br
You may then type GOODBYE, and LOGIN as one of the students, to make
sure the process worked.

4. If you want to add one new user to an old disk, do not use SETUP.
Instead, you simply type:
.br
CREATE "SAM
.br
where SAM is the name of the new user.  Wait until the computer shows
you it's done.

5. If you want to see all the procedures that do all this, type @@@PO
SETUP@@@.  Then printout all of SETUP's subprocedures.

*If your new disk has not yet been initialized be sure to follow the
process on pg. @@@@HOW TO INITIALIZE A BRAND NEW DISK.

.adjust

.undent 3
6. If any error messages appear, type I@@@.  The computer will
resume copying.*

.undent 3
7. If you want to copy another disk, go back to step 4.

.undent 3
8.  If you are finished copying, put the LOGO disk back in the top
slot, and press the reset button on the LSI-11.

*NOTE:  Error messages when copying tell which disk is causing a
problem, DISK 0  or DISK 1, as well as where on the disk a problem
is located.  If the error is on the disk you are copying from (DISK
0) you are alright -- at least the new disk won't have any new
problems.  If the error is on the disk you are copying to (DISK 1),
however, you had best stop copying (type Ctrl-Z) and use a different
disk for DISK 1.  Start the whole process again with a new disk.

HOW TO USE THE PRINTER

.undent 3
1. Make sure the printer is turned on before using any print commands.

.undent 3
2. The printer is controlled by the commands PRINTON and PRINTOFF and
the command LINEPRINT or LP.
Everything after PRINTON is printed out on the printer as well as on
the terminal, until you give the command PRINTOFF.  (Warning:  PRINTON
must be preceded by .NODRIB if you are dribbling.)

.undent 3
3. To printout a file:
.br
a) LOGIN in the person's name, then type:
.br
@@@@@LP  "filename

b) put the disk in the top slot, then type:
.br
@@@@LP [0; USERS username filename]

example:
.indent 6
type @@@LP [0; USERS JOHNNY DRIB ]@@@to print out Johnny's
dribble file.

or, @@@LP [0;USERS JOHNNY JOHNNY>]@@@ to print out all of
Johnny's procedures.

.indent 3

.undent 3
4. To printout a single procedure:
.br
LOGIN in the person's name; then type:
.br
@@@OFP "procedurename

.indent 0
(OFP is a LOGO procedure in the starter file, which includes PRINTON, a
PO instruction, and PRINTOFF)

example: OFP "SQUARE  will make the printer printout the procedure, TO
SQUARE on paper.

DISKS, FILES, and MEMORY

.ss
.indent 0
1. The computer uses two kinds of memory:

.indent 2
"working memory" -- the things it remembers now; working memory is
available for immediate use.  And,

"stored memory" -- the things that are filed away, to be recalled
into working memory later.  Stored memory is filed on a disk.  It must
be read back into the workspace in order to be used.

.indent 0
The "working memory", often called the workspace, may be thought of as a
blackboard on which we take notes, copying our solutions and
significant ideas into a notebook which we keep and refer to later.
(We may also have a section of our blackboard labeled "Do Not Erase;"
which is kept longer than the rest of the notes on the blackboard.)
The LOGO filing system, by which information which we want to save is
stored permanently on a disk, corresponds to the "notebook".

LOGO file commands are ways of getting information from the working
memory into the stored memory, and vice-versa:

READ "filename, reads information from the file you name, into the
working memory.

WRITE "filename, creates a file with the name you give, and puts
all the PROCEDURES and NAMES in your workspace into that file.

If you should happen to WRITE into a file that already exists, the
computer will print
.br
`FILE ALREADY EXISTS.  DELETE IT?'
.br
if you type@@@Y@@(no carriage return), the computer will store all the
material currently in the workspace in the file -- and completely
erase the old file.

If you want to use the same filename, but don't want to risk losing
your old files, use the WRITE instruction this way:
.br
WRITE "filename>
.br
This puts the information into a new file called "filename#2," etc.
The newest file is always labelled with the next larger number.  To
read the information from such a file, you type:
.br
READ "filename>
.br
The procedure SAVE has been written to simplify filing for students.
It automatically WRITEs a file called "yourname>.  When you LOGIN,
the computer READs "yourname> automatically.

II. SPECIAL FILES

A. Dribble Files.
.br
The command .DRIB "filename causes the computer to "dribble" all
the things typed by a user, and things the computer types, into the file
named.  This is used when you want to store everything a student does,
so that you can look at it later.
.br
.NODRIB makes the computer stop "dribbling".

To STOP dribbling, simply type@@@@.NODRIB.
This is important, because in order to use the printer, the user
must first stop "dribbling". The computer automatically stops dribbling
when you type GOODBYE.

To examine a dribble file, LOGIN at the computer with the printer and type
.br
@@@@.NODRIB
.br
@@@@LP  "DRIB
.br
(or whatever name you chose for a dribble file)
.br
This will print out the entire dribble file.  After printing it out
it's a good idea to erase it by typing
.br
@@@ERF  "DRIB
.br
(ERF is an abbreviation for ERASE FILE).
.br
This prevents the dribble file from growing indefinitely.

B. INIT files.
.br
An INIT file is automatically READ by the computer when someone logs
in.  It contains instructions which the computer carries out.  One
common version of an INIT file contains these instructions:

.indent 6
1. it clears the screen and starts the turtle;
.br
2. it prints a personal message letting the user know the computer "knows"
who s/he is;
.br
3. it READs a special file called "STARTERS
.br
4. it READs a file with the user's particular SAVE command.
.br
5. it READs each user's file of procedures;
.br
6. an INIT file can be programmed to start a dribble file automatically.

.indent 0
Any of these things can be eliminated or changed.

INIT files can be written manually or created by the procedures CREATE
or SETUP, when you create a new USER INDEX.

C. STARTERS files.
.br
The STARTERS file contains a group of procedures which are to be used as
"primitives".  That is, procedures which can be treated as though
they were LOGO commands.  Examples of procedures in a STARTERS file are
RARC and RCIRCLE, SETT, and REPEAT.  Other procedures can be added for
individual kids.

The procedures in the STARTERS file are buried.  This means that
they cannot be erased from the workspace or written into a new file.

To add a new procedure to a starter file, you have to clear the
workspace first.  Suppose your new procedure is called FOO.

.indent 2
.nofill
.ds
type BURY FOO	(this saves FOO from being erased.)
type ER ALL	(erases everything else from your workspace.)
.block 2
type ER BURY ALL("unburies" FOO and all the rest of your 
		starter procedures, so they can be filed.)
.block 2
type POTS	to make sure all the old starter procedures are in
		workspace.  If they are not, 
type READ [0, USERS STARTS STARTERS] and ER BURY ALL
.block 4
type WRITE [0, USERS STARTS STARTERS]
		the computer will type:
FILE ALREADY EXISTS.  DELETE IT?
type Y (no carriage return)
.block 3
type FIXS	to bury all the procedures in the starter file.
then type BURY ALL and READ "yourname>, to get the rest 
		of your procedures back.
.indent 0
.adjust
.ss

III. Workspace Manipulations
.br
.nofill
.ss
ER procedurename 	erases the procedure you
			name.  (This erases a particular 
			procedure from the "blackboard.")

ER "name 		erases the name you name.

ER ALL  		erases the workspace.  (This 
			erases the entire blackboard.)

BURY procedurename 	buries the procedure named.  
			(This is like putting the procedure 
			into the DO NOT ERASE section of 
			your blackboard)

ER BURY procedurename	unburies the procedure named.  
			(This puts the procedure in the 
			"erasable" part of the blackboard.

BURY ALL  		buries all procedures

ER BURY ALL  		unburies all procedures.

.indent 0
Example: You might use this to put some of your procedures into a
separate file.

.adjust
Suppose you want to put the procedures FOO, HOO, and STOO into a file
called "SUPER>.  Type:
.nofill
BURY FOO
BURY HOO
BURY STOO
SAVE 			(to put all your other procedure 
			into your regular file without
			FOO, HOO, and STOO.)
.nofill
ER ALL
ER BURY FOO
ER BURY HOO
ER BURY STOO
POTS 			(to check which procedures are now 
			in your workspace).
WRITE "SUPER>@@@.

.adjust
If you want to continue working with FOO, HOO, and STOO, keep them in
your workspace, and file all new procedures in "SUPER>@@@.

If you want to work with your other procedures, type
.br
ER ALL
.br
READ "yourname>
.br
File new things in the usual way by typing SAVE.

If you LOGIN and want to get the procedures in "SUPER> into your
workspace, type
.br
ER ALL
.br
READ "SUPER>

Save new procedures that go with these by typing
.br
WRITE "SUPER>

IV. LONG AND SHORT FILE NAMES

Every file has a long name and a short name.  The short name is
preceded by "  and is used when you are logged in or set to a
particular USER index.  "STARTERS or "KENNY> are examples of
short file names.  

The long file name includes more information, and is used when you are
not logged in or set to the index of the file.
.br
[0; USERS STARTS STARTERS], or 
.BR
[0; USERS KENNY KENNY >]

are examples of long file names.

0; tells the computer that the file is on disk 0.  Disk numbers are
usually folowed by@@;@@ in LOGO.

.nofill
USERS@@@		tells the computer that 
			it is in the index USERS.

KENNY@@@		tells the computer that the 
			name of the particular user 
			index is KENNY.

STARTERS or KENNY  >@@@	tells the computer the name 
			of the file.

.adjust
Notice that the long name uses square brackets because it is a list.
The short name uses@@"@@because it is a single word.

You may read a file into your workspace from a disk in either slot, by
specifying the long file name.  You may also write a file using the
long name.

Example 

.nofill
READ [1; USERS KENNY KENNY>]
.BR
			reads Kenny's procedures from 
			disk 1.
.br
WRITE [0; USERS MARY KENNY]
.br
			writes a file called "KENNY, 
			in Mary's index on disk 0.  
			See HOW TO COPY files for more 
			about this.

HOW TO COPY FILES

.adjust
1. Suppose you want to transfer a procedure or procedures from one disk
to another.  Suppose  "Sam is logged in on disk "0; and you want to add
some of Sally's procedures to Sam's files.

a. To transfer all of Sally's file:  put Sally's disk in the lower slot.
.br
type READ [1; USERS SALLY SALLY>]*
.BR
.nofill
			(this will read the 
			file "Sally> from the 
			directory "Sally on
			disk 1, into the workspace.)
.br
then type SAVE

.adjust
Since Sam is already logged in, this will add all of Sally's procedures
to Sam's.  Caution if any of Sally's procedures have the same
name as any of Sam's, they will not be read in; the computer
will keep the ones first in the workspace, rejecting the new version,
and will tell you so by printing SQUARE SKIPPED, or whatever.

b.  If you want only one of Sally's procedures, TO FOO, 
.nofill

i.	type ER ALL  (clearing the workspace)
ii. 	type READ   [1; USERS SALLY SALLY>]*
iii. 	type BURY FOO
iv. 	type ER ALL
v. 	type READ "SAM>  (putting Sam's stuff back in the
		workspace.)
vi. 	type ER BURY FOO
vii.	type SAVE  (new "SAM> file will have all Sam's
		old procedures + FOO)

.adjust
c. To transfer 2, 3, or n procedures, use the same process except that
step iii. becomes:
.br
BURY FOO BURY FLUB  BURY GRUB, etc.
.br
and step vi. becomes:
.br
ER BURY FOO ER BURY FLUB  ER BURY GRUB, etc.
.br
I would suggest that these manipulations are not for kids!  They
should be used with caution.  A mistake could result in someone's files
being lost.

*If Sally uses the same disk as Sam, just type
.br
READ [0; USERS SALLY SALLY>]

.block 5
2. A simpler way to copy a whole file is to use a special procedure
called COPY to do so.

.nofill
TO COPY :FILE1  :FILE2
10 .DRIB  :FILE2
20 POF  :FILE1
30 .NODRIB
END

.adjust
COPY is included in everyone's STARTERS file, for convenience.
.br
Example:  To copy all of Sally's file called "SALLY> onto Sam's disk,
in a new file called "SALLY type:
.br
COPY  [1; USERS SALLY SALLY>] [0; USERS SAM SALLY]
.BR
This assumes that Sally's disk is in slot 1 and Sam's in slot 0.
