Tic tac toe is a significant game because its mastery requires integration of two different points of view, those of the first player and the opponent.  That conclusion, which emerges very clearly from this case study, impels us to confront the interplay of micro-social experience and the personal construction of mind.  The strategy of the paper is to propose representations of the game and the mind and then use them to interpret observations of behavior.  Significant learning did occur during the case study. The six year old subject initially knew so little of Tic tac toe that she couldn't continue playing when confronted by an unanticipated response to her opening move in a game.  Six months later she was  playing both sides of the game, making "smart" moves for both players.  Two years later, she was able to prove predictions of victories by detailing the offensive use of forced moves in games worked out in her mind. The corpus of observations assembled during this period is rich in detail and reasonably complete in covering the child's overt behavior.  Our final discussion focusses on the pattern of learning and proffers a proto-theory of how experience and reflection are interleaved in a specific way to create knowledge and understanding.
