^^^^^^^^^^This opinion of the computer theorist E. W. Dijkstra comes right to the heart of our concern: "How can we learn from computers what they are best at showing^?"  If the role of procedural description is important to understand, it is important to get at the quintessence of programming because it is an explicit and accessible form of procedural description.  Further, in the environment of the Logo programming language, many of the most engaging activities of turtle geometry implicate use of a differential, i.e. a quantity by which some variable's value is changed.  Understanding designs generated by the application of a differential to a variable requires grappling directly with the concept Dijkstra focussed on as essential in understanding programming.

^^^^^^^^^^Our culture's representation of number preserves the
abstract and inclusive properties, the most developed perspective of
what the referents are.  But when numbers are used, they are used in
specific applications.  There are five distinct applications of
numbers in thenLogo language at the introductory level to turtle
geometry.  Four of htese five uses may appear as variable numbers.
Experience with numbers in these applications first as quantites then
as variables could permit consatruction of variable knowledge based on
several examples of use.  That is, with a focus on numbers as variabes
in Logo's turtle geometry, it is possible to imagine a continuous
genetic path by which a person could develop the abstract variable
idea which Dijkstra seuintessence of programming.

^^^^^^^^^^In this section, our focus is on the use of quantites, not variables (although the latter first appear in subsection [*11.3] in conjunction with iteration.  These materials are of interest as revealing some basic kinds of computer application children can pursue.  More importantly, the confusions they reveal raise the problem in a fairly precise form of how analytic the thought of a young child can be.

1Distance and Angle: MPOLY0

^^^^^^^^^^Miriam's appreciation of angles, as turning in turtle geometry navigation, has been discussed fully in the preceding section [*new name].  To a lesser extent, her use of number in specifying distance has been noted.  Let me expand a little on that useof number before introducing a different relation with numbers as angles.  Miriam clearly expected that more turtle steps would take the turtle farther.  (In the Logo Review [6;0;23], she applied two scales of change: an increment by 10 means go much farther; an increment by 1 means go a little farther.)  Similarly, the earlier cited example of Miriam's navigating around the perimeter of a triangular mouse face shows her catening the basic turtle geometry operations (FD and RT) to accomplish a functional inversion of the forward operation.  Later, Miriam showed no trouble in accepting the BACK operation as the quantified opposite for forward.  An example, when useing SHOOT in Logo session 55, Miriam commanded FD 130 to test distance to the target; she then commanded BK 130 (restoring the turtle to his original locus) and scored a point with SHOOT 130.  In another context (drawing the leg of PERSON oin Logo session 60), Miriam inverted, term-wise, a string of four forward and right operations.  One might trace that development (from a functional to an operational inversion) in detail, but it is here more appropriate in a discussion at this level to examine a secondary use of "angle" which much engaged Miriam early in The Intimate Study.  Let me begin by describing this application in its most developed form:

Langer recommends we take seriously this idea:
"all the genuine, deep delight of life is in showing people
the mud-pies you have made; and life is at its best when we
confidingly recommend our mud-pies to each other's sympathetic

The sharing of their work with others delights little girls  no less than grown men and women.  When Miriam's kindergarden friends joined her for an afternoon at the Children's Learning Lab, they most enjoyed using the computer as a tool for making gifts for others.  Thus Lizzie on one visit said she wanted pictures of a flower and explained: (Vigneete 103)

.ls 1
^^^Earlier in the year, Miriam had made copies of the imafe made by a FLOWER procedure and took on for each member of her kindergarden class; the children colored the designs and took them home.  While we waited for her FLOWER picture to come out of the printer, Lizzie saw a six-fold near-triangular polyspiral which Robby had printed from a different termial: "Wow^!  I want one of those.  Show me how to do it^!"

^^^After I started the MPOLY procedure, Miriam and Lizzie worked together for over two hours creating designs for later coloring.  Both girls made some very pretty, novel designs.  (Figure M) duplicates two of them.)

This very useful procedure for a child, MPOLY, exhibits an application of "angle" which is only distantly connectible to the use of the term "angle" as an opearand of a turning operation.  One of the practical challenges of turtle geometry is achieving a bridge between the world of mathematical desing and the everyday world of going forward and turning right. How should we conceive of that sort of development and bridge building as taking place^?  The first element to notice is the profound sense of distinction.  In the world of body geometry, a right turn would be well served by anything between 80 and 100 degrees.  In the design worlds of POLYSPI, INSPI and MPOLY (Cf. Figure M+1), the difference of one unit may be profound.  By itself, this difference in quantification sensititivity suggests the experience of these phenomena must result in disparate structures in the mind.  Material presented later argues we should describe this difference as one between two clusters of microworlds.  Let us name them the DESIGN and the NAVIGATION clusters.  We know that the DESIGN cluster is strongly related at the surface to the NAVIGATION cluster -- the self-same medium of computer displays and common names for important elements, e.g. "angle",are enough to guarantee that.  Thus,  this social contract of nomenclature should be enough for a person to assign these microworlds to a single, putative microworld cluster.  But how different must an "angle" appear when it is first how much a person turns and second, an abstract number on which some remote intelligence operates to create a mysterious product.  So it appears that the labelling of our language promises a connection of realms of ideas, but it must be through the individual's experience and labor that bridges between these disparate realmsa are constructed.  [*This observation marks a central theme of this paper].  THE GUIDANCE provided in cognitive development by the polysemantic vocabulary of the language.  This guidance is a linguistic artifact provided within and by the culture regardless of didactic intent or its absence.  Having a POLYSEMANTIC VOCABULARY means that many words have multiple senses.  The common nomenclature in different applications of a word is a persistent cultural influence for unifying disparate structures developed from diverse experiences.  The use of the same label "angle" as an operand for an operation, e.g. RIGHT :ANGLE, and as a variable name input to a procedure which controls execution of that operation upon different values of that variable is a clue to the central problem of learning/  Natural language does not mark the elevation of control, despite its being a pervasive phenomenon of human mentality; therefore, the disambiguation of nomenclature across levels of control is an essential construct by each individual.

^^^^^^^^^^Miriam's curiousity about angles qua turning operands was, at most, mild.  Her cool reponse to using WHEREIN [* either explain in full or delete para]...I mention this short episode to highlight by contrast her engagement with DESIGN procedures.

^^^^^^^^^^Let Mirism's own words from Logo session 23 describe  her appreciation of POLYSPI designs.  Of one with an angle of 116, "That's a beauty one."  When asked why she was incrementing by one the angle value input to POLYSPI, "I'm trying to find the one's I love."  As the angle variable value passed through the region of 144 degrees, creating several variant stell-form designs, Miriam declared, "They're all my favorites."  These citations do not merely testify that Miriam enjoyed "playing with computers".  More importantly, they mark part of the quality of her relation to a specific body of knowledge, the MPOLY microworld.  This world contains knowledge permitting the creation of artifacts both pretty and useful -- i.e. printed patterns may be colored and given as gifts.  Further, those adults to whom Miriam (and Lizze) gave such gifts were truly astyounded with them.  The final element of Miriam's relation to this MPOLY world was that its use led to the very striking puzzles (these will be detailed subsequently).  These three factores of utility, esthetic appeal, and puzzlement -- all knotted up in this nexus of numbers as applied to "angles" -- ll sensitized Miriam to large numbers as being interesting and worthwhile thinking about.  This concern surely supported the dramatic development of her skills in mental calculation documented in The Progressive Construction of Mind.

^^^^^^^^^^The puzzles one stumbles into in this microculture may be represented by this incident from Logo session 23 (6;2;2):

^^^After I showed Miriam one of my favorite POLYSPI designs
(angle equals 175 degrees), Miriam used "+" to increment
the angle.
Bob:^^^^What are you doing ?...You're making the numbers bigger.
^^^^^^^^What's going to happen ?  They're getting so skinny ?
Miriam:^(Laughs -- stops at angle quals 178)
Bob:^^^^Oh.  Do it one more time.
Miriam:^(Keys +.)
Bob:^^^^That's 179.  What will happen at 180 ?
Miriam:^I don't know.  (Keys +.)
Bob:^^^^Fantastic, Miriam.  Look at that !  What happened ?
^^^^^^^^(a POLYSPI with angle equal to 180 generates a single

^^^^^^^^I want my picture back (a  complaint).
Bpb:^^^^WQhat would you like to see ?
Miriam:^(Keying "-" for decrementing)
Bob:^^^^Here we go to 180....Why did the shapes go away ?
^^^^^^^^Isn't that amazing ?
Miriam:^Let's get Robby.
Bob:^^^^Hey, Robby.   Come and look at this.
Robby:^^(Entering)  Terrible !

Bob:^^^^But look.
Robby:^^That's nice.

Bob:^^^^What's going on ?
Miriam:^I invented it.
Bob:^^^^Do you have any idea of why that puzzle is ?
Robby:^^No....

^^^^^^^^^^Although Miriamw was apparently proud of herself for inventing the puzzle of 180, she forgot about it.  Two weeks later (in Logo session 27 (6;2;15), she once more stumbled upon the phenomenon of the disappearing design.  She was surprised, puzzled, and amused.  Session 27 is on I value especially as being both playful and fecund.  Some of its highlights are the following.  Before the session began, I modified the MPOLY procedure to accept only a single type of input -- a number specifying an angle value.  Two immediate consequences were that Miriam had to specify angles (instead of changing them by + and -) and she could not make pictures on the printer of the contents of the video screen.  Thus we built up a list of "good numbers" for this MPOLY world.  Miriam noticed and remarked upon the symnmetry of shapes made with angles of 170 and 190 degrees but did not appreciate it.  When I argued the fact was surprising, Miriam split the difference and rediscovered the disappearance of designs at 180.  When I suggested she try an angle of 90 degrees, she keyed instead 60.  Miriam was delighted to see the regular hexagonal maze.  (Later, she was angry with Robby for using "her" angle, 60, in a set of designs he made; each angle seemed to her the label for a new thing she invented, created or discovered.)  Miriam then began a somehwhat systematic exploration, trying in sequence the angular inputs 60, 70, 80, 90, 100.  Next she began varying the angle by one degree -- first trying out 101 and then 59 and 58.  After a break in the session, I tried to focus Miriam's attention on the cyclic symmetry, e.g. the identity of designs with angles 30, 390, and 750, instead of following her lead.  Miriam backed away from exploration then, but not before she described the design variations near "her" angle of 60 degrees:
.ls 1
.in .5i
Bob:^^^^(After Miriam had keyed 58) Why don' you go up by 1 ? Try 59 ?
Miriam:^I already did it.
Bob:^^^^You did 59 and 60 ?
Miriam:^Yeah. 50 and 60.
Bob:^^^^Do you remember what 60 looks like ?
Miriam:^ (A positive head shake)
Bob:^^^^What ?  Can you tell me ?  Can you describe it ?
Miriam:^It's sort of like this (she gestures to the POLYSPI 58), but
^^^^^^^^bigger, and it's got a make, like in it, but doesn't have
^^^^^^^^the curly things.

.fi b
Miriam's MPOLY world at this point was one of fascinating phenomena.  The central variable was "angle", but this "angle" did not connect in any directly meaningful way with the "angle" operand of a right turn which she first met in Logo session 3 [* ???]   The particularity she assigned to angles is staggering to anyone with a more general perspective.  How could one imagine "owning" and angle^?  I ifer her MPOLY world viewed the miniworld of computer designs as one of disorderly but engaging objects.  Miriam explored this range of phenomena in an orderly way.  But  incrementing by tens did not suggest some sensible way of separating desings, by the numbers, into mazes, messes, pretty stars, and "ones with the curly things".  More local exploration, e.g. at 58, 59and 60 degrees, may have offered some hope of order.

^^^^^^^^^^We may conclude this discussion of using distance and angle by describing Miriam's knowledge as in two clusters, of NAVIGATION and DESIGN.  These clusters may be thought of as related by common terms but unconnected.  That is, Miriam could not relate the operations of the NAVIGATION cluster to the artifacts of the DESIGN world, as she did so clearly in this Vignette (126; 6;11;5) at the end of The Intimate Study:
.ls 1
.in .5i
^^^As I sat at work in the reading alcove, Miriam came to join me.  SHe offere to sit in my lap, but I protested to being busy and turned her down.

^^^Miriam moped a little then crawled on my bed and into the center.  She began to move and spin in a most ouzzling and disttracting fashion.  "What are you doing^?  You're driving me batty."  My gripe iinspired her to explain.  Requesting a pen and a 3x5 card, she drew thereon a right rectangular polygonal spiral to show what she was doing in her"crawling on the bed game".  Her verbal description was that she was "making one of those maze things".

.ls 2
.in
This late witnessed connectedness is lacking early in The Intimate Study.  It is clear evidence that Miriam can relate knowledge of NAVIGATION to DESIGN.  How should we think of these microworlds as related before they are explicitly connected by knowledge about the relation of parts and phenomena in both worlds^?  Let me set out my best proposal, though it be one still quite inadequate.  The two worlds are related (I describe thema s being a "cluster" of microworlds) by their major parts potentially fitting as descriptions of parts of some situation.   That is, if confronted by  problem involving "angle", Miriam would be tempted to describe it in two different ways, the one deriving from her concept of angle in NAVIGATION and the second from DESIGN.  I say Miriam is "tempted" because these descriptions are active and propose themselves as ways of seeing the situation such that it decomposes into recognizable parts.  From this point of view, a cluster of microworlds is a system of descriptions competing to apply to a class of problems.  If description simply compete for application, ther is a minimum of structure in their relations.  How structure developes in a cluster of microworlds is a central concern of [*this whole studuy].  In [*section 13] we will pursue the question of how NAVIGATION and DESIGN come to be related as witness by Miriam's "crawling on the bed game".

^^^^^^^^^^A final problem for this section, one merely to be raised but not resolved here, may be crystalized in the form of this specific question.   "When Miriam began her `somewhast systematic exploration' of angular inputs to the MPOLY procedure (i..e. 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 degrees), from what specific knowledge structures in the mind might such advice come^?"  Such a question, generalized, is a central question of thinking: "How do discrete knowledge structures interact in the solving of problems^?"  What is novel in this question is daring to raise it with some hope of finally answering it.  Mind theories focussing on control structure make it possible to frame competing hypotheses about such a question.  One class of hypothesies would be that such advice comes down from above.  That is, there exists a general body of problem-solving knowledge which some problem-solver in the mind can apply.  Such hypotheses lkeave us with the mysterious difficulty of the problem-solver's origin.  A secoind class of hypotheses woudl be that somehow such advice "bubbles up" from ancestral microworlds through the control structure of the mind.  (I believe the specific  is explainable as one wherein the MPOLY world accepted advice of an ancestral world of number knowledge: "When investigating big numbers, try incremnets of ten".)  A third class of hypotheses would be that somehow connections are established between knowledge microworlds within clusters -- i.e. that very local kinds of knowledge aboiut knowledge develop.  I believe this latter happens only rarely but is most significant, for the process (the correspondence of perspectives as described in The Progressive Construction of Mind) generates those kinds of knowledge which may later appear as abstract, problem-solving knowledge, i.e. the last is ultimate a hope for explaining the genesis of the first, the appearance of the problem-solving homuncukus in the mind.

^^^^^^^^^^In this [*section], "angle" has been a term relating disparate worlds of thought.  We have discussed Miriam's diverse understandings of angle.  Their ultimate relation is through appreciating iteration.

^^^^^^^^^^Dijkstra further explains his valuation of the centrality of variables in programming by relating their use to iteration:
.ls 1
.in .5i
.nf L
^^^...[I]t is the repetition that really calls for the concept
of "a variable".  (Without repetition one can restrict oneself
to "quantites" the value of which has to be defined at most once but
never has to be redefined as in the case of a variables.)

.ls 2
.in
.fi b
Thius argues that variables are important because of their function, because they permit the use of powerful iterative techniques.  I hold that the idea of a vriable is important for a different reason, and one I consider more profound.  Recall the discussion [*where am I going to put this ??] of Aristotelian abstraction and reflexive abstraction, the later as Piaget's generalization of the mathematicians axiomatic method.  What I judge most profound in the concept of a variable is that it makes this process of abstraction accessible to the concrete experience of non-mathematicians in a clearly articulated form.  We weill return to this observation in [*section 15].

^^^^^^^^^^The clusters of Design and Navigation hitherto distinguished are realted in that the former is rich with phenomena from the iterative application of operations of the latter.  Miriam did not initially understand this relation.  (My speculation about how she came to understand it is proposed in [*section 13].)  I ca highlight precisely what she did not know by contrasting it with what I do know.  I see the initial Dsign cluster in my mind as recognizing three different quantites, three applications of number; they are distance, angle, and an iterastion limit.  Two of these quantites are passed as operands to procedures invoked in the Navigation world.  The third quantity, call it COUNT, an iterastion limit, is used to control invocation of procedures defined in terms of subordinated microworlds of Naviugation.  This distinction is important because it shows I mark the control structural implications of the quantity's application.  Such is a very important distinction which Miriam failed to make, but one may still ask "Is that all^?"  Of course not, for to appreciate the distinction of these clusters one must recognize that althouigh distance and angle have a basic parity in Navigation, in the Design cluster, angle is the dominat quantity while distance merely changes scale.  That is, a square is a square of any size, but a "square with 93 degree corners is something else, no matter how large or small it be.  Beyond the relative salience of angle and distance, specific values of the quantites are notable in quite different senses.  For example, in the Design cluster, a POLYSPI 175 (with the turtle turning 175 degrees at each corner) is remarkable for generating a very pretty design.  I can not imagine any simple world of navigating where 175 degrees is remarkable at all.  Contrariwise, the angles for generating closed polygons are good to know if you want to navigate through space and returen to an initial location.  But in the world of Design, those same angles make relatively boring desings and they are only useful to know as anchors of variation from which one may begin explorations to find interesting designs (which typically arise from the unplanned interaction of subordinate operations).  Finally, I am quite well aware of relationships between the closeure of polygons and the emergence of crisply perceptible spiraling arms in POLYSPI's.  Such knowledge, which emeplifies the correspondence of perpsectives, does not involve direct control of subordinate microworlds, but it does offer guidance for exploring phenomena in the lesser ordered world.

^^^^^^^^^^What knowledge of this did Miriam own early in The Intimate Study^?  The material presented [*in section 10] showed her developing sensitivity to the angles 90 and 180 degrees.  In contrast, the previous subsection showed Miriam preferring angles such as 116, 80, 160, and146 to those we recognize as generating the simplest closed polygons.  Thus, this distinction of which angles are interesting clearly marks a discrimination between two worlds of thought.  In her exposure to SHOOT, angle was first required, and more or less easy to perceive, where the appropriateness of a distance quantity could only be judged after the angle was nearly ocrrect.  In her use of MPOLY, distance faded to insignificance.  Miriam noted how a PLYSPI of 60 degrees was similar to those of 58and 59 degrees, though lacking the "curly things", but she did not appreciate, perhaps did not even suspect, that there might be some close relationship between the regularity of the hexagonal maze and the six armed spiral emerging from the figure with an interated turing of 59 degrees.  There is no indication at all that Miriam comprehended the iteration-connection of these worlds of thought ab initio.

^^^^^^^^^^Miriam was introduced to iteration as a distinct theme through the medium of a procedure generator, TIMES, which permitted her to repeat any string of turtle geometry commands.  At her first meeting the TIMES generator, in Logo Sesson 13 (6;1;16), she found it easy to use and enjoyed the artifacts (visual displays) created by her procedures.  Having just begun, I must here choose to segregate the material of diverse consequences by thematic contrasst or functional differences.  The themes of iteration are two: first is introduction of a COUNT quantity; second is following Miriam's reaciton that the "growing" of shapes on visual displays is very engaging and our pursuit of how to do that.  The functional differences, implicit in the TIMES generator, all revolve on the particular method of limiting the iteration process.  Let us first follow Miriam's interest and then return to her specific interaction with the generator.  Throughout the sessions with TIMES, Miriam's interest was in creating images tat would "grow" according to her satisfaction.  When the images did not grow, as for example the start made through her procedure GO$ by repeating [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 144], Miriamd eclared she preferred another to it.  (See Figure M+2).  I believe she found the simplest, regular figures boging.  As we tried developiong desings, Miriam's objective was generating the sorts of figures she had encountered using MPOLY.  When I first modified a simple repeating procedure to function as a POLYSPI procedure (in Logo session 21), Miriam did not udnerstand how it worked buyt adopted and enjoyed the procedure (PSTAR, see Figure M+4 in the next subsection).  We came to distinguish two different kinds of growing figure, the first growth being achieved through the non-overlapping of the turtle's path when a partial sum of his turns was close to but not equal to 360 degrees.  For example, if the turtle repeats [FORWARD^100 RIGHT^122], three iterations leave a partial angle sum of 366 degrees and draw an unclused "triangle".  Successive near-triangles appear displaced by a rotation around a center.  This is the growth of turning which first delighted Miriam but which she later complained of (as "not growingbigger") in Logo session 22.  Pursuing the question behind this complaint of what we could change in the procedure PSTAR (for "pretty star", [FORWARD^100 RIGHT^146]) to make it grow bigger (the second kind of growth), finally inspired Miriam to inquire directly, "What's a variable^?" From her framing that question in the context, I infer this point was where she began to make that problem her own.  (Miriam's specific introduction to programming variables is treated in [* RLDBUG>]  We are now in a position to describe more precisely than Dijkstra's earlier citation precisely how iteration requires the use of variables in turtle geometry designs.  This discussion will lead is through Miriam's introduction to iteration at a more detailed level of reference.

^^^^^^^^^^Let us distinguish between two different types of procedures, making the POLY and POLYSPI classes of designs.  A POLY design is the figure made by a fixed instructioon program.  For example, repetition of [FORWARD^100 RIGHT^144] five or more times will trace a star.  Some POLY desings are closed polygons, such as our star, but other POLY designs are not.  The near-triangles described previously (created by repeating [FORWARD^100  RIGHT^122]) is a POLY design which exhibits the growth of turning.  POLY procedures use iteration to create designs which grow bigger.  Do they require variables^?  Not absolutely.  If you wanted a star-form POLYSPI of a hundred sides, it would be quite possible to generate a procedure of 200 fixed instructions wherein the difference between each forward operand and the next one would be a constant, e.g. [...FD^82 RT^144 FD^84 RT^144 FD^86  RT^144...].  We usually avoid such procedures for at least three reasons.  First, large procedures take up a lot of space in a computer memory.  The second reason is esthetic; such rocedures would usually be considered laughably inelegant.  Finally, often you do not know in advance how many steps you procedure should have; perhaps you do not care how many steps are to be executed.  The number of lines which comprise a design is rarewly a criterion for the design's value.  If youdo not know or care how many lines will make up your design, you can not generate it with a specific number of fixed instructions.  It is the variuable number of instruction executions, the defering of that judgment as to how many iterations are required, which requires the use of programming variable to make designs of the POLYSPI class.  Miriam wanted to make designs which grew bigger, and she cared not the least how many lines it took to make a design.  Therefore, she needed to know how to use variables.  Miriamwas introduced to variables in the context of iterations produced by the TIMES generator.  This use involved her with COUNT, a quantity for controlling the iterations of some generated procedures.

^^^^^^^^^^The purpose of the TIMES generator was to provide Miriam easy access to the use of iteration, but suicvh could have been achieved by providing a "repeat" function for her use.  Why should a procedure generator be preferred to a simply executable primitive function ?

^^^^^^^^^^The TIMES generator satisifies three objectives simultaneously.  FIrst, it ermits easy creation of procedures of the POLY class.  (A companion editor, VARY, permitted transforming POLY procedures into POLYSPI procedures.)  This gives the child access to the power of iteration and permits his engagement with and enjoyment of designs without requiring he first know how to write procedures.  Secondly, the generated procedure is an object which could be names, owned , and removed -- by its separate existence -- from the mystery of the process which generated it.  Consider this typical example of TIMES execution for its immeidate contrast with use of a REPEAT function

[**see text pg. 497 and edit before keying]


Using a REPEAT function achieves the same results in terms of the turtle's actions but does not create a procedure as an intermediate product.  To have such a procedure is important for cognitive as well as for affective reasons.  Procedures such as PSTAR can become objects of analysis which a child can examine even before knoweing how to encode a procedure/.  Thus they can serve as very simple examples of what a procedure is, i.e. what its parts are and what they do.  To read and understand PSTAR, Miriam did not have to worry about the TIMES generator at all.  (The discussion of subsection 11.4. concludesthat Miriam did not find this feature useful.)  If I adopt Howard Peele's distinction between a "black box" ( a device you use effectively but whose innards you do not care or dare to examine) and a "glass box" (an object whose functions are comprehensibly displayed by its internal structure), I would summarize the second objective as providing functional capability through a black box (TIMES) which creates glass boxes (such as PSTAR).  The intended use of TIMES is genetic -- to help a child understand iteration so well that the generator TIMES becomes obsolete to him.  Providing a REPEAT function may obscure more than it illuminates the iteration it renders accessible.  The third objective, to exhibit the COUNT of count-controlled variation first as a quantity then as a probably comprehensible application of a variable, becomes possible through generating different forms of iterative programs.  Since the complications possible went beyond Miriam's experience and achievments within The Intimate Study, let me summarily describe TIMES' capabilities then proceed to Miriam's experience.

^^^^^^^^^^Three primary means of encoding iterative procedures are step-duplication, looping, and recursive invocation.  (I make no claim that there are no others.)  Step-duplication, which requires that a fixed number of iterations be specified at procedure generation, simply repeats the basic string of commands, the KERNEL I call it, as successive procedure steps for that fixed number of times.  For example, in Logo session 28, Miriam generated a procedure, called POLY, with 24 duplicated steps.  As first generated, the procedure appeared like this:

This procedure was generated when Miriam responded with the number "24" to TIMES' query "STOP ON COUNT OR DATA CONDITION^?"  At another time, in Logo session 14, Miriam's response to that uestion with the key word "COUNT" caused generation of a decrementing, count-controlled looping procedure, TRI:

The previously mentioned PSTAR procedure, one of unlimited tail recursion, was generated by Miriam's ignoring the query for definition of a stop rule.  The TIMES generator was complete enough to permit othert controls of iteration, e.g. exhaustion of a set of objects in a list as the limit of recursive invocation, but Miriam never went much beyond these three basic forms of iteration, so let us stop preliminaries and go on to how Miriam used TIMES.

1Experiences with Iteration0

^^^^^^^^^^Before we turn to the rational and ramifications of Miriam's introductyion to iteration, we should inquire what preceding knowledge, what UR-CONCEPTS, of iteration Miriam owned and expressed.  Recall first Miriam's initial interpretation of RIGHT 90, which was, "turn right a little bit ninety times".  She began that turning and was controlling her action by incrementing a count.  Second, note the song "Foofoo",[* reference put where] witnesses decrement count control.  Next, repeating an action till stopped is pervasive.  Consider, for example, the "spinning dizzy" game Robby and Miriam enjoy: they stand with arms outstretched and spin on and on until they can do it no more, then stagger about giggling and disoriented.  Such is simple iteration finally interrupted by an extrinsic constraint.  Further, the idea of repeating a procedure until a controlling set of objects is exhausted must be very basic.  For example, one eats candy till he has no more and then stops.  Conversely, the building up of a set of objects until it is complete is represented in Miriam's composing the backward alphabet in A STORY [* reference where].  These example I cite here not to argue that any particular one served as a specific precedessor but merely to indicate how pervasive and varied are ideas of iteration which a child would typically bring with him to an encounter with computer procedures.  These citations argue that it would be strange indeed if a child ere unable to understand a variety of forms of iteration.

^^^^^^^^^^The most striking change must be in our expectations.  We originally argued how easy it would be for Miriam (or some other child of her age) to understand iteration.  Now it seems we are reduced to arguing that she could distinguish between two quantites with the evidence of both tests and analyses before her.  Though others may judge this a falling off, I find it illuminating and troubling.  My sense of this interpretation is that the process of analysis is profoundly retrograde to the primary developmental mechanisms of the human mind.  The elevation of control names the process of packaging functions for invoked executions.  The idea that such packaged functions are directed in executions by "input variables" assigns too great a degree of control to invoking processes.  Better we think of control elevation as produicing specific functions which may be perturbed or modified by some qualifications.  That is, the elevation of control may be likened to closing the lid on a black box.  Once yuou forget about what is inside, do you deal with "input variables" (of residual lucid definitionthrough the transparency of "glass box" enclosure") or do you cope with the imperfectly recalled correlations between a modifiable function and an input message of limited range^?  The analysis of The Progressive Construction of Mind, focussing on relatively simple learning involved in addition, probably presented too-well-defined examples of microworld interconnection to represent the vaguer relations of one microworld to another in more complicated dmains.
