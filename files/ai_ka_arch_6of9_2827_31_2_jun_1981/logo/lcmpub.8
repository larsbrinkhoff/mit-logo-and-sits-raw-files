For the past two years, the MIT Logo Group has been carrying out a curriculum development project, "Logo Methods in Science Education Using Low Cost Home Computers", with funding from the National Science Foundation (SEDxxxxxx). Materials from this project are in draft form and will soon be available for publication. With this letter we initiate exploratory contacts with publishers who might be interested in publishing materials developed during this project.  This is the first step in a publication plan which is being submitted to the National Science Foundation and which must be approved by NSF before any publication agreement can be made.


While discussions with publishers are taking place, we plan to make draft versions of the booklets available for trial teaching use in extremely limited numbers, and at sites that agree to provide feedback on their effectiveness. The information obtained from diverse trial sites will be extremely helpful in preparing final versions for publication.

The materials as presently configured consist of a collection of booklets designed to help students learn Logo, and carry out explorations in mathematics, physics and biology. The booklets can be used with any of the existing or anticipated microcomputer implementations of Logo. One booklet about using the Logo operating system, will be written in two versions - one for each of the existing micro-computer implementations: TI Logo for the TI 99/4 Personal Computer, and MIT Apple Logo for the Apple II. 
 



The set includes nine booklets with two optional booklets possible. Principal authors are Seymour Papert, director of the MIT Logo Group, and Daniel H. Watt, Research Associate, with additional contributions by John Berlow, Harold Abelson and Andrea diSessa. The booklets can be used with students of different ages. Booklet One is designed for adults - teachers and parents. Booklets Two through Four can be used by students as early as fourth grade. Booklets Five through Nine will probably be most useful in grades six, seven and eight. Drafts of booklets Three and Seven are included with this letter as samples of the material to be provided.

Although we have prepared the materials as distinct booklets, we are open to a range of suggestions for how they could best be published. We envision two possibilities for publication arrangements:

.in 5
1. Publish materials more or less "as is" with minor editing changes, possible changes in page format, etc.

2. Publish with significant changes in format or content, to meet the particular needs of anticipated audiences. In this case we would expect to work closely with a publisher on revisions, but the cost af any such revisions would have to be suported by the publisher.

.in 0
In both cases the MIT Logo Group reserves the right to approve all suggested changes, large or small.

Our criteria for selecting a publisher will include the following considerations:


.in 5
1. The ability of the publisher to reach relevant markets including schools, home users, computer stores, etc.

2. The effort that the publisher is prepared to make in publishing, promoting and disseminating the materials. This could include, for example, providing adequate training for sales personnel and being able to provide workshops for potential users.

3. Provisions for royalties in accordance with the policies of MIT and the National Science Foundation.
