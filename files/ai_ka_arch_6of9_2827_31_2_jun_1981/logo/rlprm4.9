1The Nucleation of Microworld Clusters0

^^^^^^^^^^The intention of this section is primarily theoretical -- to make sense of the earlier material of the chapter.  We begin with a summarizing formulation of how these various experiences may be organized in an attempt to view the material in a way compatible with the simpler challenge of The Progressive Construction of MindQE>.  We conclude with an attempt to interpret the experience through which Miriam came to understand interation as the genesis of a microworld which can function as an archetype.

^^^^^^^^^^omit 13.1.1
^^^^^^^^^^the following needs drastic revision

The microworlds formulation must be extended considerably to encompass the challenge of this material.  Let me criticise the QUERY formulation as  way of revealing those p[roblems we must confront/  The first criticism is that the "perspective" can not be extended to cover any situation more complex than simple calculation problems.  This leads to a summary description of the material in sections 10-12 as a response.  Thesecond criticism is more profound, that the competition between microworlds is wrong or vaguely described.  The most direct wat of connecting this discussion with The Progressive Construction of Mind is to begin with those formulations and attempt to cope with the criticisms.  Since the response to the first criticism leads to the bind where the second can not be escaped, let us proceed in that sequence, recalling in this more detailed discussion that we weill conclude with the view presented in section 4.5.

^^^^^^^^^^Microworlds are distinguished by their perspectives, the parts into which the mental structures parse a situation.  We described those structres as activated by the presentation of a question.  For example, "how much is 76 plus 25^?" verbally presented, activated the SERIAL microworld (and others in turn) of mental calculation when the Serial world perspective analyzed the query to parts more fully than competing microworlds could.  Can this query formulation be carried over to Miriam's broaded computer experiences^?  The prospect does not look promising because the questions put to the worlds of calculation appear so simple.  What is an equivalent simple sort of question these computer-related microworlds might confront^?  A simple qeustion of common form, relevant to most of the microworlds, is "What is a good value for ANGLE^?"  But that depends so much on the activity^!  Precisely so.  A value of 180 might frequently be good in using the DRAW+ program.  For SHOOT, the answer must be whatever value reduces the difference between the current heading and a line through the target center.  The question does not even apply to SEAHORSE^!  In The Progressive Construction of Mind, we concluded that the activation of one microworld rather than another, e.g. Paper-sums instead of Serial, was much influenced by the presentation of the query.  What similar presentational distinctions should we be on the lookout for in the computer-focussed cluster of microworlds^?  Before any microworld could possibly confront so simple a question as "What's a good value for angle^?", some prior questions must have been answered.  Let me represent this process of prior commitment to a problem solving context by the question presented below:

.ls 1
.in .5i
.nf L
1.^Do you want to go to Logo today ? Or stay home^?Or go elsewhere^?
2.^[At Logo] What do you want to do ?  (The basic and obvious choices
^^^were from these possibilities: use the computer, do puzzles, socialize,
^^^get snacks, run around.)
3.^[When using the computer] What sort of activity interests you today ?
^^^Would you like to use a game (e.g. SHOOT), an interface (e.g. DRAW+) ?
^^^Would you like to use the Logo interpreter directly ?

.ls 2
.in
.fi b
If problem questions can only artise in a context selected by such prior commitments, we might expect that each subsystem Miriam encountered must have engendered a new microworld.  Let uis now follow this speculation in detail.  In order to preserve easy reference to the context of the related experienc, I choose to refer to each of these conjectural microworlds in Miriam's mind by the name of the associated Logo interface used.  (The risk of confusing references to programs with those of mental structure is small; when confusion is possible, specific references will be used.)  Figure N  attempts a preliminary sketch of Miriam's computer-focussed knowledge as described so far.  It shows an initial grouping of microworlds in five separate clusters.  The difficulties with the figure are several, but let us approach the most serious one first.  The grouping into NAVIGATION and DESIGN clusters appears to be based on a superficial similarity ofphenomena more than anything else; that may be, of itself, a legitimate organization to impose, but it does not connect at all with a view of microworlds and clusters as defined by knowledge of the parts of a situation.  This is a more specific restatement of the criticism that the microworld formulation is not obviously applicable to situations  more complicated than doing sums.

^^^^^What ius a perspective as applied to DESIGN worlds^?  How does it relate to its phenomena^?  Let us return to a prior example, the Serial world of mental calculation.  When confronted by a query, "How much is 76 plus 25^?", the Serial perspective analyzed the parts of the question to a form on which its procedures could function.  Specifically, Serial's perspective broke the numeric terms into tens and units.  The procedures re-grouped the components, acquired intermediate results, and retunred the final result to the inquisitor.  We can ask of this example, "What is the phenomenon analagous to the design produced by some drawing procedure^?"  Is not the direct answer that the result of calculation is the "phenomenon" of the Serial world^?  Now if we consider the perspective of Serial as creating an analyzed description of a whole situation, we note the perspective must:
.ls 1
.in .5i
.nf L
1.^represent the requirement for a result; the result is the output
^^^of the knowledge when it is applied.  Let us say the perspective
^^^should represent the function of the microworld knowledge.
2.^represent the arts, the entities of the microworld, both operands
^^^and operations.
3.^represent the relation obtaining between all the parts of the
^^^perpsepctive (the result is one part).
.ls 2

.fi b
Further, it is quite possible that other aspects of a situation must be representable.  We will describe this representation as a collection of slots.  SLOT is the generic name for the place where a value for a variable goes.  (Recall that a variable is the association of a name with a slot.)  The process through which values are assigned to slots is key.  The slots are not passive but active.  The processes which assign values are demons, at least one for each slot.  By using this erm I mean that for each slot a pattern recognition process is activated, i.e. assigns sopme aspect of a situation a variable value, when its pattern is recognized.  We may think of each slot as having a little man in it who "wants" to find in the situation some aspect which he can assign.  Having come this far together, another step or two will lead us to connect directly the microworlds of Miriam's computer-focussed experience with those of The Progressive Construction of Mind.

^^^^^^^^^^First consider mental calculation.  Queries were [put to Miriam in the form "How much is 75 plus 26^?"  Are such the same as this second question of different form, "What number plus 25 makes 101^?"  They need not be seen as different.  The same specification of slots could respond to each of these situations, different as they appear on the surface.  (I believe there are, in fact, separate microworlds for response to each of these surface query forms, but consider it an empirical question I bypass here.)  Is this second question not one where the result (the phenomenon of The Progressive Construction of Mind) is seen as a component, iu.e. as another part of the whole which the perspective describes^?

^^^^^^^^^^Similarly, we could ask these two questions:
.ls 1
.in .5i
.nf L
"What are good value of our variablkes to make a make ?"
"Will [S 10 60 4] draw a maze ?
.ls 1
.in
.fi b
We conclude that the same sort of description can apply to situations where the desideratum is either a "result" or the specification of some "input" to a process creating a result.  Indeed, thedistinction between "input" and "result" can be maintained only if the process realting the two has no accessible inverse.  (This must frequently be just the case during development.)  We expect that it is through the cleavage of microworlds with compatible perspectives, i.e. amalgamation, that the reciprocity of a procedure and its inverse become manifest.

^^^^^^^^^^Now think of paper and pencil calculations.  As in the Paper-sums world of vertical form addition, where an addition problem decomposes into a set of component subproblems, we find similar organizations in the computer-focussed microworlds.  We can see that the parts of a story or letter in the TEXT worlds, e.g. the individual lines of the text being composed, can be written one after another (in any order) until the composition is completed.  Thus they have a serial organization of beginning, middle, and end with indefinitely repeated subproblems in the middle section.  Figure N+1 directly compares the queries confronted in the Paper-sums world and the two TEXT micro-worlds after a commitment, in the first, to "do some adding" and in the others to write a story or letter.  This repetition of subproblem queries is characteristic of the SHOOT world, MAKEDOTS, R.A.F. and of DRAW+ as well (inthe latter, one selects, locates, and assigns sizes to component shapes, erasing unsatisfactory trials until satisfied).  Repetition of subproblems is not so obviously characteristic of worlds using iterative procedures, such as TIEMS, the FAMILIES world, or SEAHORSE, but they can be seen that way.  The case is slearest in the use of MPOLY programs.  One version asks specifically "What angle^?" should be used in the next design.  Was Miriam's objective in committing to MPOLY ever merely the creation of a single design^?  I think not.  Her focus may have varied considerably.  One common possiblity would be creating a set of designs.  From this point of view, the question "What angle^?" corresponds to the question "What line next^?" although there is no reason to believe Miriam's objective to create a set of designs was as specific as her intentions in composing a story or, as in the extreme case, dictating in entirety the song "Little Rabbit Foofoo".  If this line of reasoning holds for the MPOLY world, does it not hold as well for the other worlds^?  Specifically, it does hold for the FAMILIES world, for the SEAHORSE and TIEMS and SLOT worlds.  The outstanding example is SEAHORSE, where Miriamwas clearly exploring the behavior of the S procedure with varying input values.  Why have I dwelt on this particular issue, the apparent repeated confronting of relatively simple queries within a context to which one has previously committed himself^?  Precisely because it appears to undermie utterly the competitive activity of microworlds, which I argued earlier is the mental matrix from which learning emerges.  The atomicity of microworlds, an apparent consequence of the association of knowledge structures with the specific contexts in response to which they were constructed, conjoined with the important of presentation and objective argues first that there is no such thing as a functioning cluster of compting microworlds and in consequnce, that the development oif structure, organization in the mind, cannot derive therefrom.  This is a most painfull conclusion, if true.

^^^^^^^^^^What I argue now is that a theory of confusion is integral with a theory of learning, in the specific sense that a cluster of microworlds is, at the detail levlel of slots in disparate perspectives, a network of confusability.  There is no reason to believe that a person's top-level commitment to some objective stifles the active agenda of residual objectives in the mind.  Think of the hopes you once had, the many lives you might have led.  Do not such thoughts plague your every attempt at concentration^?  The Walter Mitty in every mind is evidence worth attending to, testimony that the apparently coherent mind is preeminently interruptible.  This once granted, why should one believe that all such interruption must come from the profoundest levels of an organisms being^?  The point restated here was argued before: cpognitive structures are active.  Another metaphor -- think of the mind as a classroom.  A question is put to you, little-man (because others have committed to solve a particular problem), "What's a good value for angle^?" -- and you have no idea.  Here the other children, "I know^! I know^! Listen to me^!" and you are o the hot seat....  Have you ever taken bad advice^?  From someone who answered with certainty a question whose context was beyond his ken^?  I am sure we both have.  Does not this willingness (or need) to provide some answer, when your own resources are paralyzed by conflict or utter ignorance, does not this characterize confusion^?  Whence comes such "bad" advice within your own mind if not from other microworlds which have enough in common with the currently dominant perspective to see at least a part of it as "theirs"^?  If microworlds with similar perspectives can intrude during confusion, this is phenomenological evidence that there is reality in the competition of microworlds.  A discrimination of levels of slots in microworld perspectives permits us to save the position that the competition of active microworlds is a major factor in mental organization and development.  But this saving is not without cost.  The competition must be described as at a slot-level of activity instead of at a perspective level.  There can be no such simple things as a cluster of microworlds as described in The Progressive Construction of Mind.  We must substitute for it the idea of a Network of Confusability.  Let me attempt now to exhibit, in as simple a case as is useful, a confusability network and how it derives, at least partly, from the genesis of knowledge.  The EEL programs and the turtle geometry primitives, which Miriam knew best through SHOOT, were joined together as the Logo language compatible subsystem in DRAW+.  The three microworlds embodying her knowledge of these programs constitute a genetically based system of interlocked perspectives.  That is, both the EEL and SHOOT worlds were ancestral to DRAW+.  Confusions about what to do when using DRAW+ can be traced to the competing advices of the two ancestral worlds.  Contrasting the perspectives of these three worlds, as is done in Figure N+# permits us to see how precisely DRAW+ is constructed with the guidance of EEL and SHOOT.  The confusability in this example is basically limited to the relational details.  The manipulation of parts in EEL was performed by mnemonically encoded operations which applied to the current component shape.  The manipuilation of parts in DRAW+ is through the agency of the turtle.  Not merely are procedure different; the entities acted upon are different.  The competition of separate knowledges at this level of detail is witnessed by Miriam's question about a component shape when using DRAW+: "How do I make it bigger^?^^B^?"  Although at that point Miriam had been using DRAW+, locating one shape after another by placing the turtle in position, guidance from the "wrong" ancestor surfaced when her experience with SHOOT did not suggest any specific way to alter the basic size of the component shape.  This exemplifies genetically based confusion of detail.  Such confusions resurface when constructed knowledge of the conjunct world (DRAW+ in this case) is only partly formed or imperfectly recalled.  Think of Miriam's confusion in her early encounters with R.A.F.  That genetic confusion was inescapable until a (temporally) post-cedent ancestor (MAKEDOTS) was established and capable of competing withth edifferential oriented guidance of SHOOT.

^^^^^^^^^^In any newly created microworld descended from more than a single ancestor the possibility of genetic confusion is endemic in the society of demons.  How is the confusion suppressed^?  Consider again Miriam's hypothesis that enlarging shapes in DRAW+ could be effected by keying a "B" command.  That hypothesis is wrong in fact, but it is a perfectly good hypothesis.  In both artificial and natural problem contexts, there exist many sensible possibilities which do not obtain.  The point is that such confusions are suppressed on the basis of experiment or of knowledge already in the microculture.  We can think of my rejection of Miriam's hypothesis as establishing a MUST-NOT-CONFOUND LINK in the network of confusibility, i.e. this legitimate operation of EEL does not generate a corresponding one in DRAW+, and this represents a specific sense in which knowledge about EEL must not be confounded with knowledge of DRAW+.

^^^^^^^^^^This new formulation leads us to a new nd unexpected insight into the nature of microworlds.  The boundaries of microworlds can be seen as the system of must-not-confound links derived from the individual's putting questions to nature and the microculture.  That is, microworlds are the large-scale images of already suppressed confusions in the mind.  Recall the simultaneous activity of microworlds as a central element of the insights whereat the Serial and Conformal worlds were engendered in The Progressive Construction of Mind.  Pushing this new view further, we can sharpen those results into a seeming paradox: insight results from a balance where confusions are suppressed for ongoing functioning but not so well suppressed that insights are inhibited.

1Archetypes and Cluster Nucleation0

^^^^^^^^^^Have we seen any microworld of Miriam's experience to this point which might be an archetype candidate^?  Not in my judgment.  If learning is a long term process (even though critical moments of insight might occur in an instant), significant learning occurs rarely.  If insights take various forms, one cannot expect to capture all of them in a single study.  And yet, however much one may make excuses, I hold the idea of cluster nucleation important enough to pursue it even on a speculative basis.  The story told by this subsection is a fabrication only in the sense that its interpetation goes beyond what a cautious critic would admit as proper.

^^^^^^^^^^After a partial summary of Miriam's computer-focussed experiences (more material is presented and analyzed in [*RLDBUG >] , Miriam did not give evidence of understanding how microworlds of the Design cluster related to those of Navigation.  She could use iteration but there was no evidence she understood it as she so obviously did in the "crawling on the bed game" reported in this vignette (6;11;15):
.ls 1
.in .5i
^^^As I sat at work in the reading alcove, Miriam came to join me.  She offered to sit in my lap, but I protested to being busy and turned her down.

^^^Miriam moped a little, then crawled onto my bed and into the center.  She began to move and spin in a most puzzling and distracting fashion.  "What are you doing^?  You're driving me batty^?" I complained.  My gripe inspired Miriam to explain.  Requesting a pen and a 3x5 card, she drew thereon a right rectabgular polygonal spiral to show what she was doing in her "crawling on the bed" game.  Her verbal description was that she was "Making one of those maze things."
.ls 2
.in
Where did this connectedness (of pattern to action) in her knowledges come from^?  The use of turtle geometry commands with DRAW+ will not explain it because the drawings of that subsystem have a character more agglomerative than the iterative character of generated dsigns.  Miriam em,bedded turtle commands in POLY procedures in using the TIMES program, but the evidence is against her understanding what the kernal did.  (Recall Miriam's belief that the unit repeated 24 times in the POLY procedure was the square shape and not the [FORWARD 200 RIGHT 90] commands specified in each of the 24 steps.)  The most we can say is that the TIMES program may have inspired a weakly held belief that there must be some connection between FORWARD and RIGHT commands she understood and the polygonal designs she did not understand.  The knowledg acquired through using the Slot machine could have strengthened the belief primarily because the appearance and function of that terminal emphasize each procedure step in turn more than they emphasize the "packaging" of steps into procedures, but secondarily because the output opf those FORWARD and RIGHT commands was shown to be the same as the output familiar from the lexically encoded MPOLY programs.  The introduction of input variables wioth the S procedure of the FAMILIES world was a tactical success but a strategic blunder.  The searchfor number/design correspondences (a la SEAHORSE, i.e. with little or no concern for the values' functional import) may have even obscured the question of how the turtle commands related to the design phenomena.  So ended the formal sessions of The Intimate Study, without evidence of the later witnessed understanding.

^^^^^^^^^^Since I lived with Miriam, it was an ever present temptation to follow up her continuing development.  Thus, on one of those days when the blizzard of '78 left our family snowbound for about a week, while mife tended our newborn I entertained Robby and Miriam with a project we recorded as Home  session 24. The children wanted to play with a set of cuisenaire rods I had brought home from the Children's Learning Lab at Logo.  I agreed, on condition that we begin with a project of my choosing.  The scenario I proposed was this: after they sorted the rods by color (and thus by length as well), I would begin to make something; their problem was to describe what I was making and what my procedure was.  I began the construct whose development is shown in the pictures of Figure N+4.
.bp
1FIGURE N+40
.bp
^^^^^^^^^^After I placed four rods, I asked the children what I was making.  Robby recognized immediately and described my objective as "a swirl, a maze".  Miriam then chimed in with his answer.  Subsequently, I asked Robby to hold off expressing knowledge until I discussed my questions thoroughly with Miriam.  Robby acceded, albeit with difficulty, to my request.  When I had placed eight rods, I asked the children if they could describe my procedure.  Miriam could not, but when I focussed her attention of the legnth of each piece, she remarked, "You're growing it bigger and bigger"; and when questioned, noted the increment weas one.  When Robby added rods of length nine and ten and Miriam justified his action by arguing "it goes iun order...littlest to biggest", I challenged her with the question of what followed "orange" (this color identifies the largest cuisenaire rod, of ten cm.).  Miriam volunteered that orange and white (the white is opne cm.) would be next and other combinations would do as well:
.ls 1
.in .5i
.nf L
Miriam:^The orange is ten, so youneed eleven to go next.
Bob:^^^^You would speculate then that my procedure says something
^^^^^^^^like "everytime I put a rod in ...what^?"
Miriam:^It should be one bigger than the last one.
.ls 2
.in
.fi b
With the mentioned minimal prompting, Miriam understood well the incrementing of length.  In striking contrast, she showed considerable difficulty with the role of the turning in the construct.

^^^^^^^^^^When I set down the eleven-length (the orange and white rods), I did not orient it perpendicularly to the previous length.  Miriam declared the arrangement incorrect but had considerable trouble specifying what was wrong.  When she rearranged the rods to locate them correctly, Miriam simply interchanged the placement of the orange and white rods.  From this action, I infer Miriam considered the placement incorrect because two rods of the same color were adjacent to each other -- but not incorrect because the one rod was colinear with the preceding.  Here I asked Robby to explain what I should have done:
.ls 1
.in .5i
.nf L
Robby:^^You should go...ah... a right 90 angle.  It could be
^^^^^^^^orange, a right 90, white and orange.
Bob:^^^^And what should I do after this next orange, Rob ?
Robby:^^You could probably do an orange and red (twelve units length).
Bob:^^^^(Placing the two rods colinear with the previous two.)
Robby:^^Hold it ! You should do a right again.
Bob:^^^^Oh. (Correcting placement) Miriam, what do you think
^^^^^^^^I should do next ?
Miriam:^A RIGHT 90, green and orange (length thirteenunits).
Bob:^^^^(Placing the rods) And what next ?
Miriam:^A RIGHT 90, purple and then orange.
.ls 2
.in
.fi b
This is the point at which Miriam brought together in a comprehensible relation the steps and the result of a maze-generating procedure.  As she and Robby completed the maze by using all the rods in the set, a variation developed which was like a change of scale.  As the side lengths approached thirty centimeters and with all the long rods used up, calculating the length of a side became burdensome.  Miriam introduced a red rod (two cm.) as a measure of the length by which the currently-developing rod line should exceed the length of the next inner rod line similarly oriented.  (Notice that the outer rod line also began two cm. before the inner line.)  This "differential" measure served till the last step, when I inquired of Miriam wherther she would find in the pool of remaining rods enough lengths to complete the 32 units required.  Miriam counted the length units of the preceding rod line and determioned there remained enough small rods with lengths sufficient for that requirement.  The point is that Miriam was comfortable with these alterante descriptions and easily changed frtom one to the other.

^^^^^^^^^^If we review this rods-maze experience, several striking aspects stand out.  One is the exyensive guidance Miriam received from the microculture.  The tasks she confronted focussed onthe articulate description of procedures.  When she could not begin, I directed Miriam's attention: "Look at the length of each piece."  When she got sidetracked, concerned with color alteratio instead of turning, Robby's description of my error definitely redirected her thought.  Specific characteristics of the task appear important: it began simply; its developing complexity, however, ultimately drove Miriam to her own differential and relative procedure.  (I refer here to her use of the red-rod spacer as a length criterion.)  We can say oif Miriam's knowledge implicated in the task that she worked with a familiar objective (creating a maze), worked with familiar objects (cuisenaire rods), and applied familiar operations (adding one to a number, turning RIGHT 90, repeating a procedure step).

^^^^^^^^^^I consider these experiences of the rods-maze and turtle on the bed to have integrated and thus culmninated the development of Miriam's knowledge about iteration.  We should not try to summarize how these disparate knowledges finally related to each other.

^^^^^^^^^^Thus far we have primarily at tended to the construction of new knowledge, both in Miriam's learning about addition and in her computer-focussed experiences.  In the latter, she often appeared to have the experience and miss the meaning.  Did she ever really come to understand variables^?  The answer is, I believe, "yes", but an affirmative highly qualified because of the particularity of her knowledge.  I will now propose that making sense of new experiences, appreciating their meaning, often involves the re-construction of that new knowledge.  In the terms I have used, I state my conclusion as follows.  The reconstruction of knowledge follows its partial foretting and derives from a reorganization among microworlds.  That reorganization is the conncetion of "new" knowledge through an archetype to basic knowledge systems.  The connection follows upon the insertion of this archetype, likely a post-cedent ancestor, in the knowledge structure.  Let me now proceed to apply this scheme to the microworlds of Miriam's computer focussed experience.

^^^^^^^^^^If we contrast Miriam's understanding of what she was doing when assembling the rods-maze with her penetration of using TIMES, we get the maximal contrast between well-comprehended and ill-comprehended procedures.  Well-comprehended procedures (the sort employed in building the rods-maze) appear to be nearly immediate consequences of the obective in mind and the quiddity of the entites to which they are applied.  Within the TIMES world, Miriam knew that turtle geometry primitives could be used as an iteration kernel, and that when she supplied a name, the TIMES programs would produce a procedure she could executre.  Miriam had no idea of how that happened, no idea of why the "stop" query was an essential question, and no idea of how the primitives of the kernel related to the shapes drawn by her procedures.  This latter relation is the one renderedaccessible through her experience with the rods-maze.  I propose that the task of describing my procedure, then assembling the maze created a microworld wherein she could relate line creation and turning to a final design through well-comprehended procedures.  That the procedures of the world be well-comprehended is necessary for the rods-maze world to function as an archetype.  But there is more required.  Applicabilityis one aspect.  Recall from [*  here reference to the issue of "guidance" in puzzles and its non-portability] Miriam's work with picture puzzles.  The distinction drawn through the puzzle sessisons was between the guidance provided by the picture and the constraints provided by the piece fitting.  This was a distinction that made little or no difference to Miriam.  There may wellcome a time when that distinction will prove useful to here, but it has not yet done so.  The knowledge of the PUZZLE world does not now function as an archetype.

^^^^^^^^^^Contrast now the tole played by the Interlocking Strings puzzle within the interpretatins of One Child's Learning (through which it has served as asn archetype).  A second aspect is that the archetype must embody a powerful idea.  By this I mean the idea must be demonstrably useful in problem solving over the domain where it applies.  The third aspect is that an archetype must with basic knowledge systems of the mind.  By these basic systems I refer to those knowledges elaborated and completed in the eocene of personal development: the systems of body movement, vision, language comprehension, and others.  These knowledges are owned in the very intimate sense that they, in their progrtessive elaborations, comprise the mind one is conscious of as the self.  Knowledge connected to these systemns becomes a part of the way one is in and sees the world; but knowledge not so connected is feeble because, when forgotten, when less accessible through mnemonic tricks. it will not be possible to reconstruct it as it was.  The refconstituted knowledge will bear less the impression of the experience that of the mind that is struggling to recall.  We conclude that the rods-maze world was, for Miriam at that time, able to function as an archetype.  Be clear that I make no claim that Miriam instantly undertook the reconstruction of the relevant DESIGN microworlds; not at all.  But if she later attempted to understand the working of the S procedure of the Families worlkd or the procedures produced by TIMES, I expect the Rods-maze would be for her a salient, fecund, and effective archetype from which, by constructive analogy, she would proceed in the reconstruction of what was forgotten or never learned in those worlds.  What reason is there to accord the Rods-maze world this status ?  I interpret the Turtle of the bed game itself as the behavior through which Miriam was integrating hjer new maze-knowledge back into the world of her own body movements.

^^^^^^^^^^If this interpretation I proffer of Miriam's computer focussed experiences is sound, we have as an immediate conclusion a new insight which strikes right to the heart of a major psychological puzzle: is learning centrally or peripherally driven ?  We have seen at many point the pressure, direction, and guidance the microcultures of my family and the Logo project have brought to Miriam.  The culture is pervasive, and yet it does not seem to be all that effective in a direct sense.  What Miriam took to herself as an archetype through the "turtle on the bed gasme" was the rods-maze knowledge.  The event occured a month after assembling the maze from the rods.  I consider the adoption oif this knowledge as reflecting the sense that the knowledge was appropriate to her as a person.  But this statement is not to be taken as a simple answer.  We offer instead a pattern: the environment inundates a person with experience to cope woth which he constructs more-or-less makeshift mmicroworlds by analogy to whatever he knows that appears as similar; such knowledges are feebles unless connected to the basic systems of intimate knowledge comprising the mind; such connection, if it occurs, may follow the development of post-cedent ancestral microworld; such connection can only be expected to occur if the person's mind constructs the connection to the basic systems of knowledge.  The three characteristics marked in our conclusion about the nuclkeation of clusters are these: first is the hallmark of the archetype, the sense that the parts of things and their relations are intuitively obvious; next is the epistemological generality of the archetype -- at this point the microculture intervenes most forcefully by defininf what problems are valued; the final element is the learner's sense that the knowledge is appropriate to himself.  Knowledges such as the Rods-maze world which link through themselves even more fundamental knowledges (such as movement and vision) advance the unified understanding of experience and further, in our interpretation, serve as a nexus through which clusters of diverse problem contexts can connect dependably to the fundaments of mind.  This connection ofnew knowledge to the person's mind must be the goal of education though it be beyond the educator's direct control.
