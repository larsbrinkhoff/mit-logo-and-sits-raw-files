bold(Changes in Apple LOGO Version 2)

.ls 2
Most of the new features of Apple Logo version 2 have to do with color drawing commands.
.nf l

BACKGROUND		The turtle can now draw on seven different backgrounds.

BACKGROUND   0          Black
BACKGROUND   1		White
BACKGROUND   2		Green
BACKGROUND   3		Violet
BACKGROUND   4		Orange
BACKGROUND   5		Blue

(BACKGROUND   6 is also black, but different from BACKGROUND 0. This will be explained later.)

PENCOLOR   or   PC	The turtle can draw in seven colors.

PC   0        		Black
PC   1			White
PC   2			Green
PC   3			Violet
PC   4			Orange
PC   5			Blue

(PC   6   has a different effect which will be explained later.)
.fi b

The  pencolors have consistent effects in all backgrounds,  except that orange and blue cannot be drawn on a green or violet background, and green and violet cannot be drawn on an orange or blue background. On a green or violet background, pencolors 4 and 5 make the turtle draw green and violet. On an orange or blue background, pencolors 2 and 3 make the turtle draw in orange and blue.


If you use  BACKGROUND   6, you will get the sharpest possible lines, but the color will not be consistent.

PENCOLOR  6  or  PC  6  has a special effect which you can think of as a  "color reversing" effect. When it draws over a blank space, it leaves a line. When it draws over a line drwan by pencolor 6, it erases it.  When the turtle draws over a line of another color, strange effects occur. When it retraces the line, the original colors will be restored.


To erase any line on the screen, just draw over it with the pen set to the background color.

Other changes in LOGO Version 2:

Screen modes:

FULLSCREEN   or   <CTRL> - F   makes the entire screen available for the turtle.

SPLITSCREEN  or   <CTRL> - L   splits the screen, allowing four lines of text

                  <CTRL> - T   makes the entire screen available for text.

<CTRL> - F,   <CTRL> - L,   or  <CTRL> - T, can be used while a procedure is running.

FULLSCREEN   and SPLITSCREEN  are also normal LOGO commands and can be used in procedures. (There is no command equivalent to  <CTRL> - T.)

TURTLESTATE   or   TS    Now outputs two more parameters, the background and pen colors, in addition to XCOR,  YCOR,  HEADING,  penstate, and turtle visibility.

SETTURTLE   or   SETT   can now be given two additional paramenters, background and pen colors.


TOWARDS  :x :y   needs two inputs, the x and y coordinates of a point, and outputs the bearing of that point from the turtle's current position. For example, if the turtle is at home,  TOWARDS  100  100  will output  45.00.


Conditionals,  AND  and  OR have been changed:

AND   is now   ALLOF

OR   is now   ANYOF


Paddle inputs:

PADDLE   0   and   PADDLE   1   output the value of paddle setting,  0 to 255.

PADDLEBUTTON   0   and   PADDLEBUTTON   1   output   "TRUE   if the button is pressed, and   "FALSE  if the button is released.


File commands:

DELETE  has been replaced  by  ERASEFILE.


picture saving commands have been added:

SAVEPICT    "filename   saves a turtle picture as a file.

READPICT    "filename   reads a turtle picture file.


ERASEPICT   "filename   erases a turtle picture file.


Debugging Commands:

TRACE   turns on a function that causes each procedure to be stepped through one line at a time, by  typing  <RETURN>.

NOTRACE  turns off  TRACE.
