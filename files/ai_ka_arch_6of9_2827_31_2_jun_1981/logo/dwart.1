The Computer Revolution - Priorities For Educators
.ad

     In writing this article I feel a little bit like an old fashioned preacher,  preaching about Heaven and Hell to an earthbound flock. In his desire to make them aware of possibilities that transcend their daily experiences, he makes use of tricks of the trade -- fantastic images, inflamed rhetoric, appeals to emotion -- to overcome this gap in vision.
     I often feel this way when talking about the possibilities and perils involved in using computers in education. For the last four years I have been involved with the LOGO Group at MIT - in a series of exciting research and development projects that have the aim of allowing young children to control computers. At the same time, I have become aware of many dangers involved in the widespread proliferation of computers throughout society. I am distressed by the general indifference and ignorance of the education community with regard to the social changes being introduced by computation. If this article lapses into "preaching" at times, please make allowances for the difficulty of  sharing a vision of the future - only dimly perceived even by computer experts - with an audience that has had little or no experience with computers.
     Although the Computer Revolution has been with us for some time, there are still a few years before the most dramatic effects of small personal computers will be felt. There is still time to develop thoughtful, considered policies that will allow schools (and other educational institutions) to provide an appropriate education for adulthood in the l980s and beyond. During the last two years, many schools have begun to introduce microcomputers at a variety of educational levels. Unfortunately, decisions to do so have often been poorly informed about availible hardware, software and educational methodology. More importantly, such decisions are usually made without a clear perspective on the future roles of computers in society, on the dramatic potential for changes in education over the next decade, or on the methods necessary to bring about those changes in a positive way.
     As I speak with a variety of people concerned about the impact of computers on education, I find that most of them are reflecting concerns about how computers can be used to meet traditional educational goals more effectively: Can computers improve reading scores? Does programming computers help children learn arithmetic more quickly? How can computers be applied to learning about the Greeks and Romans? How can we use computers to mainstream handicapped students? Can computers make education more cost effective? Which school systems have been making the best use of computers in recent years, and how can we emulate them?
     While these are important questions, I believe that they are of secondary importance to a broader set of questions which are not being widely asked: How can schools help prepare students for a computerized society? What are the basic educational needs of students who will be  graduating from high school in the l980s? What new learning opportunities are provided by computers? How can teachers be retrained and re-educated to help students meet those needs and take advantage of those opportunities? What problems can we anticipate as we begin to make use of computers on a large scale? How can we begin to think about using computers in schools? It is these broader questions that I plan to raise in this article, hoping to place the more immediate questions in a broader perspective.
     
Computers are likely to have a major impact on education in several distinct ways, each of which needs to be understood and incorporated in our thinking about computers and education:

1. The proliferation of computers in society is creating new social needs and problems which demand new approaches by educational systems.

2. Computer based education systems are creating new learning opportunities.

3. The introduction of computers into schools is creating a wide range of new problems which must be dealt with as we meet new social needs and take advantage of new learning opportunities.

     In the rest of this article I plan to elaborate the impact of computers on education, and to suggest some priorities  in considering the roles of computers in education. In a hypothetical case study I will examine the long term consequences of decisions made by many school systems in the past, and, finally, I will suggest some steps to be taken by educators as they begin to address these issues.

II - The Potential Impact of Computers on Education

     I will now consider the three points raised above, in greater detail.

1. The proliferation of computers in society is creating new social needs and problems which demand new approaches by educators.

     Computers are rapidly transforming the living and working conditions of the American public. Within the next ten years most  occupations will require some type of interaction with a computer. Consider the way in which computerized data processing, closely followed by word processing has transformed the business world, impacting with equal force on clerical and secretarial workers  as well as managers and policy makers. Or consider the challenges currently being faced by auto workers, as auto manufacturers introduce programmable robots to work side by side with humans on an assembly line. Or the way in which clerks in a supermarket or department store  "talk to a computer" as they ring up a customer's purchases. 
     Computer literacy is now a basic skill! By computer literacy I mean a broad based understanding of how a computer works, the knowledge of computer languages with which to control it, the ability to provide input to computer programs and to interpret computer output in terms of the program that generated the output. A student who leaves school comfortable and confident with computer programming skills and who understands the underlying logic of computer operation, will be in a position to compete for the most meaningful and rewarding jobs. A student without such skills will be limited to more menial roles with few prospects for advancement.  Genuine computer literacy requires more than a single high school course with that title. It requires a familiarity with and control of computers beginning in the earliest grades, and continuing to include relatively advanced computer applications in the high school years.

     Of equal importance is the need to educate a citizenry capable of understanding and controlling the impact of computers on society. Computer literacy will be an integral part of such an education, but cannot in itself adress the issues of social control of computer applications, which I predict will become a major socio-economic-political issue of the future, rivalling such issues as energy, nuclear power, pollution andthe arms race. Computers are now used at all levels of economic decision making. They were used in the decision making that guided our government's conduct of the Vietnam War - and are presently being used to plan contingencies for future wars. Computers are used to determine who is entitled to use a credit card or cash a check. Computers have a major role in the control of nuclear power plants. These are only a few of the ways in which computers are having an imopact on political decision making. You can probably think of many more.
     How can we prepare students for the problems involved in ensuring that human beings and human values are in control of an increasingly computerized society? Here is a major challenge for educators. I know of no curriculum at the pre-college level that begins to deal with these issues. A few college level courses now exist that deal with "Technology and Society." The type of material presently availible for schools has been provided by the computer industry, and carries the message, "The computer is your friend!" Hardly the whole story.

2. Computer based education is proving new opportunities for learning.

     During the 1960s there was a wave of enthusiasm for the use of computers in education, based on the supposed effectiveness of using a computer as a "teacher." This movement was met by a corresponding wave of hostility as educators realized that computer "teachers" tended to trivialize the teaching and learning process, and threatened to replace a human environment by a mechanical one. In addition, the systems of the '60s were more costly and complex to use and maintain than their enthusiasts had predicted. Although computers could allow a student to proceed through a body of material at her own pace, they could not allow for a wide variety of learning styles or the real subtlety involved in complex skill development. Computer "teachers" were most effective in tasks requiring drill and practice - hardly the educational nirvana hoped for by enthusiastic advocates of computer assisted instruction. 
     Today, fifteen years, and many millions of dollars later, the task of developing intelligent computer teaching programs that can be matched to a learner in a non-trivial way is still a major research endeavor. Large scale "universal" education systems such as the PLATO system now being marketed by the Control Data Corporation have proven to be too costly and limited for most schools and are finding their primary use in industrial training programs. Many drill and practice applications, on the other hand, are being widely distributed as hand calculator devices by companies like Texas Instruments, whose Little Professor, Dataman, and Speak And Spell are being marketed directly to the general public as "educational toys," largely bypassing the schools. This is not to say that drill and practice has disappeared from the computer education scene. Increasing numbers of "software houses" are producing "teaching programs" of different sorts for the most popular microcomputers. Most of these remain to be tested and evaluated in schools or homes.
     In the late l960s John Kemeny, now president of Dartmouth College pioneered the use of time-sharing and the programming language BASIC, to make computer access availible to all students at Dartmouth. BASIC was the first computer language developed for non specialists. Languages like LOGO now bring use of a computer within the range of children as young as seven or eight. A LOGO learning environment also provides rich "microworlds" within which children can explore as they learn to write their own computer programs. The most famous LOGO microworld is the world of "Turtle Geometry," in which children control a robot Turtle which moves around the floor, or draws lines on a TV screen. The actions of the Turtle make computer programming a concrete activity, within the reach of young children and mathematically unsophisticated adults.  Controlling the Turtle allows the student to gain control of a geometric environment which provides a concrete framework for the normally abstract subjects of algebra, geometry and trigonometry.
     Students who engage in  LOGO activities learn to make explicit descriptions of what they are trying to accomplish, in a way that the computer can  "understand." They learn to break a large problem into separate parts, to view their own errors as a natural part of the learning process, while at the same time they develop the satisfaction and confidence that come with being in control of the computer.
     Turtle Geometry is only one of many microworlds that can be or have already been created for children. In a "dynamics" microworld students can write programs for a Turtle that obeys Newtonian laws of motion. In a "biology" microworld they can explore the simulated behavior of simple animals. A music microworld allows children to create their own tunes, accompaniments and harmonies, then test, revise them and play them back - while creating a computer program which forces them to make explicit descriptions of the tunes they create. A video games microworld provides students with the opportunity to develop their own versions of "Space Invaders" or "Hockey." In an "interactive" microworld, the computer can be programmed to play a game, ask and respond to questions, or carry on a conversation. These learning environments are intriguing to students of a wide range of ages, interests and abilities. The educational design has gone into creating these powerful environments in which the children learn with the help of an experienced teacher - creating a plethora of possibilities from which the child can make choices - rather than into creating a "program" which channels the child in one particular direction. This combination of openness, and genuine power over the environment, makes possible a kind of learning partnership between a teacher and a student which is difficult to achieve in more conventional settings.

     Another powerful learning opportunity is provided by using a computer as a word processor. This can be thought of as a super sophisticated combination typewriter/secretary. As you type a letter, story or article, you can make corrections, rearrange and reorganize your text, format it in any way you like, and, when you're ready, make a the computer print out a professional looking copy. Of course, later you can retrieve the text, modify it in any way you want, combine it with some new writing, and make as many copies as you want. Faculty members at universities in which students have access to computer text-editors have noticed significant improvement in the quality of students' written work. And this without any change in the TEACHING of writing! A few case studies indicate that this kind of effect occurs with younger students as well. One girl in the Brookline LOGO study used her computer exclusively for writing stories. This student, a non writer who receives daily tutoring for her learning disability in the school's Learning Center, blossomed into a creative writer who proudly distributed multiple copies of her products to teachers, parents and classmates!
