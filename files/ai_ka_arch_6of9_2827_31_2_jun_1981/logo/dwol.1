I- The potential impact of Computers on Education
.nofill
A - The creation of new social needs to be met by education
.in 2
1- computers transform living and working condition
.rin 2
a- office automation
b- computer controlled robots in industry
c- word procesing in writing
d- communication and data retrieval systems
e- supermarket clerks, etc. etc.
.rin -2
2- Computer Literacy a Basic Skill of the 80's and beyond
.rin 2
a -computer languages and programming
b - understanding the output of computer programs
c- understanding input to computer programs
d - understanding graphical information and how to produce it
.rin -2
3- Education for Citizenship in a Computer Age
.rin 2
a- applying human values to control of large omputer systems
b- applying human values to control of everyday use of computers
c- deciding which applications are appropriate, and which are not.
.rin -4

 

B- Computer based education systems create new learning opportunities 
.rin 2
1 - Enhancing traditional educational goals and methods
.rin 2
a- computer as "teacher" mainly used for drill and practice
.ad
b- computer "teacher" replaced by hand held fixed purpose devices, such as
Little Professor or Speak and Spell
.nofill
c- "intelligent CAI" still a major unresolved research issue
.rin -2
2- Computer simulations bring new "worlds" into the classroom
.rin 2
a- Huntington Project science & social studies simulations: Water Pollution; Hammurabbi.
b- Bork's dialogues based on simulations in physics 
c- Use of simulations in professional training of pilots, doctors, etc. 
.rin -2
3- Computer programming as aid to problem solving, thinking
.rin 2
a- "conventional" use of computers in algebra courses
b - LOGOlike computer programming microworlds
.rin -2
4- Computer text-editing as a writing aid
5- Computer generated graphics and music opening up new creative experiences
.ad
6- Computer based record keeping systems mnake possible a greater degree of individualization
.nofill
7- Communication with large computer systems 
.rin 2
a- access to a variety of CAI materials (a la PLATO)
.ad
b- access to information of all sorts - specialized dictionaries, encyclopedias, statistics, etc. etc.

.ce
C - Problems to be Anticipated in Introducing Computers into Education
.ad

.in 2
1- Computers can lend themselves to mechanistic models of learning and teaching which may be harmful to children if abused or overemphacised.
.rin 2
.nofill
a- overuse of "drill and practice" or inappropriate "programmed learning"
.ad
b- misuse of computer based record keeping in ways that reduce teacher flexibility and control over learning environments
.nofill
.ad
c- misuse of computers in making educational decisions about a child - especially a  handicapped or learning disabled child
.nofill
d- Some children may become "addicted" to computer use
.rin -2
.ad
2- There will be a long period of adjustment to new educational approaches that go beyond "computerizing" the existing curriculum
.rin 2
.nofill
a- The problem of training teachers to use new methods well
.ad
b- The problem of developing appropriate curriculum materials - or using poorly developed commercial materials; good software takes a long time to create and debug
.nofill
c- The problem of public understanding of new methods
.ad
d- the problem of obsolescence of existing approaches during the transition period - example: inability to incorporate calculators into math curricula
.nofill
.ad
.rin -2
3- We may develop an elite group of "computer experts" among teachers and students, which perpetuates a division that already exists in society; non-experts may become the next wave of "second class citizens
