An Example of Following a Child's Interests

0     Geometry is a term that covers a lot of ground -- and other spaces besides.
My application of the term to our work, as much as it was limited in scope, is
justified by Robby's having dealt with the primitive space descriptions of
Turtle Geometry and Coordinate Geometry.  The latter designates any point in 
a plane as an ordered pair of numbers.  The first number is commonly referred to
as the X-coordinate (X is the horizontal axis); the perpendicular or vertical
Y-axis defines the second number of the pair.  Turtle Geometry is an action
based geometry developed for use by children.  The space is described by 
movement through it.  The primitive terms of description are actions, executed
commends to go forward some distance or to turn right some angle.  The commands
are implicitly addressed to an agent, the turtle (represented either by a
mechanical robot which lumbers across the floor or as a triangular cursor
which zooms through a bounded space on a computer video display.  The commands
are state-centered, i.e. go forward so far from wherever-you-are and turn right
so much from wherever-you-are-heading.  These are the basic geometric concepts
Robby dealt with during our project.
     Coordinate Geometry was introduced to Robby by the use of READY-AIM-FIRE.
This system of procedures was written at his suggestion and for his delight.
During the preceding school year his reading interests had been dominated by
the Second World War, with a sharp focus on naval war in the Pacific and the
air war in Europe.  The scene set for using the system was that of a tailgunner
protecting his boomber from attacking fighters.  Think of the nearby parts of
the bomber as providing guidance for locating his gunsight while thte fighter
appears in a second, remote space.  Figure II - 1 shows the gunsight.  It is not
reset to any home location after the command FIRE.  Thus in Figure II - 2,
the gunsight appears where last an airplane was shot down.  The command READY
draws an airplane at a random location and orientation.  A "YES" response
to the query "GUIDANCE ?" draws scaled X and Y axes.  The gunner then attempts
to  locate his gunsight on target through one or more AIM commands (he may
AIM as many times as necessary before commanding FIRE).  The AIM command
requests inputs for the X and then Y coordinates to which the gunsight
will move.  Figure II - 3 shows the gunsight moved horizontally from its
former locus in response to the input alue "145" for the X coordinate.  
Figure II - 4 shows the gunsight moving on target vertically after the
X coordinate had been set as in Figure II - 3.  With the gunsight on target,
more or less, the gunner commands FIRE.  The cannon fire is represented as
"BAM BAM BAM".  If the cross are located within the area of the fuselage,
theairplane explodes, "KA-BOOM".  Figure II - 5 shows that when the fifth
plane is shot down, the gunner is congratulated as an "ACE".  If the cross hairs
are not on target, the airplane disappears, i.e. the gunner has missed his 
opportunity. But whenever he commands READY, a new target appears in a different
location.

     This game fell into its specific scenario because of Robby's interests.
Its design, more generally considered, reflects my objectives and pedagogical
poinmt of view.  I wanted to present Robby with a game similar to SHOOT,
a turtle geometry game, but one based on this contrasting deometry so that
subsequent explicit comparisons could be focussed on the differences os
spatial description.  But if the children had seen immediately the similarity,
they would have not accepted the different spatial description as justified by
the differentness of the problem.  That is, if I had offered them SHOOT in
absolute coordinates, they would have rebelled, rejecting the idea as stupid
in extreme. I would have agreed with them but for one thing.  I believe that
sensitivity to muiltiple descriptions is an important and powerful aspect
of intelligence. My justification would have been quite beyond their appreciation,
and since we are democrats in the home (at least THEY are), I needed to be
somewhat devious and manipulative to engage them with the issue.

     Robby had a good experience with R.A.F.  It took him a while to accede
to the description, but when he caught on his engagement was intense.  Let me
be specific.  I had hoped to leave the lab early that day.  A friend with his
infant daughter was awaiting a ride home with me, but Robby would not leave.
He kept us at the lab an hour beyond my preference, shooting at airplanes so
that he could become an "Ace".  He reached an ainsight and, in effect, demanded
to consolidate that learning at that time.  The permanence of the insight is
shown by his subsequent use of the coordinate space description of space 
as an ancestral perspective through which he interpreted others.  For example,
some months after the close of our study, when I introduce the children to the
game "Go", Robby interpreted the alphabetic/numeric location descriptions of
places on the board as "being like that X Y business " in R.A.F.

     The basic problem of education is how to instruct while at the same time
respecting the self-constructive character of mind.  Logo has identified the
design of knowledge environments specifically for children as a central
contribution to solving the basic problem.  R.A.F. is an example in little
of how following the interests of an engaged child can provide guidance for
designing microworld facilities which both serve a child's objectives 
(whatever he may define them to be) and embody a significant ways of making
sense of the world at large.
