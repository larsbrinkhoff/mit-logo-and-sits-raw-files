Appendix A:  Program which modifies the 3500 Keyboard.


this is code wirtten on the 3500 which results in Turtle Commands being activated as the
result of pressing a single key.


the selection of keys which would produce the turlte actions was not random.  Rather, 
these buttons were chosen so that they would be separated by at least another key on 
all sides.  This was to minimize chances that incorrect commands be activated accidentally.
The other keys (those separating the commands) were given numerical values which could
be used as arguments to the commands.  Defining keys in this manner did not result in
incorrect actions as argument keys only resulted in actions when the previously pressed key
had been a command needing an argument.  When this occurred, a message would tell the user to 
initiate a command.  Similarly, pressing an action key after an action key needing an 
argument would inform the user that an argument was needed.
