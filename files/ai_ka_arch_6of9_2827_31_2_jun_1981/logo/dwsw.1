I.  Introduction


This paper describes a project designed to provide an innovative
computer-based learning environment for learning disabled students in
grades 5-8.  The students will learn LOGO, a computer language
for elementary school students and will engage in a variety of
computer programming activities designed to enhance basic skills and
to develop problem solving abilities.  They will  learn to use a computer
text-editor for creative writing.  The project will provide extensive
training and support for teachers of learning disabled students, and
will develop a set of curriculum materials and a teacher methodology
which will allow these methods to be successfully
implemented in other schools.  The project will provide a model of a
computer based learning environment which can be adapted to a variety
of student populations.

The LOGO computer language and associated activities have been
developed by the MIT LOGO Group over the past twelve years.  Significant 
learning gains have been observed among students who have had the opportunity to
participate in these activities, gains which we attribute to a variety of 
factors.  The prestige associated with learning to program a computer
leads to an increase in motivation for most students.  The LOGO learning 
environment operates best when children are allowed to decide the content
and pace of the activities they undertake and this control of their own learning
has a strikingly beneficial effect on their self-confidence.  Programming in
an interactive computer graphics situation lends itself to an emphasis on 
process rather than product, in that the typical tasks are structured to enable 
direct feedback on the intermediate steps during the solving of a problem.  A
discrepancy between what is intended and what actually happens is thus more
readily available to both teacher and learner than is usually the case, and such
an error or "bug" becomes a source of insight into the learning process, into
the problem solving process.

Typical beginning LOGO tasks in Turtle Geometry (see Appendix) mobilize and
help to cultivate skills in spatial reasoning often not otherwise utilized in the
conventional curriculum and this fact can be an advantage to those whose gifts
lie in this direction.  In the process of exploring problems in Turtle Geometry, students 
gain concrete mathematical experience which provides a foundation for more abstract 
mathematical subjects such as algebra, geometry and trigonometry.  In addition,
they develop skills in reading, spelling and typing in the process of inputting
their programs and in deciphering the computer messages; the availability of a
text-editor enhances this experience and provides motivation and a 
practical tool, allowing some students to make dramatic progress in creative
expression.

All of the above remarks apply most especially to any learning disabled students
participating in LOGO activities, and following some promising preliminary results with 
this group, it was decided to set up a project specifically directed at this area
of special educational need.  

A central goal of the project concerns the need to help teachers of learning 
disabled students develop the skills and confidence required to integrate
computer use into students' individual education plans.  The project will also
provide documentation, curriculum materials and assistance to other schools
seeking to adopt the methods developed.

II.  Background
.twinch 5

1Karl is a tall, awkward boy who has severe learning disabilities.
In sixth grade, his general academic achievement was at approximately
a second grade level.  His attitude toward school seemed to be one of
hostile resignation.  At this point Karl was given the opportunity to
program a computer, during the course of which he overcame severe
typing and spelling difficulties to learn LOGO.  Working over a period
of thirty-six hours, Karl demonstrated skills and understandings in
geometry, non-verbal reasoning, organization and logical problem
solving, that had not been previously evident to his classroom
teachers or his learning disabilities tutor.  (See Appendix II for a sample
of Karl's work.)

In an interview following the conclusion of the classes Karl was asked
to solve the problem of finding all the possible different
arrangements of a group of blocks of four colors.  Rather than lay out
all the blocks and compare arrangements--the strategy used by most
students--Karl slowly calculated that there were twenty-four possible
arrangements.  When the interviewer confirmed his solution, he picked
up the microphone of her tape recorder, and speaking directly into it
said, "I'm a brain!" (Papert, et al., 1979)

.twinch 6
0Karl's story is a dramatic example of what can happen when a
learning disabled student is provided with a new kind of learning
opportunity--one which allows him a measure of control over his own
learning, and one which enables him to make use of skills which have
not been developed in his prior school experience.  In the remainder
of this section we shall discuss the nature and extent of the learning	
gains illustrated here.  First we  provide some general background
information.

LOGO - A Computer Language and Learning Environment

The work proposed here is directly linked with a series of research
and development projects carried out at MIT and elsewhere during the
past twelve years.  The computer language, LOGO, was originally
developed as a computer based learning environment in which children
could learn computer programming, problem solving and mathematical
thinking.  The LOGO learning environment is based on the developmental
psychology of Jean Piaget as well as an approach to the design of
computer languages as problem solving tools developed in the study of
Artificial Intelligence.  (Feuerzeig, et al., 1969; Papert and
Solomon, 1971; Papert, 1971)  In the late sixties, the developers
of LOGO chose to base their learning environment on computer systems
that would not be available to the general public for ten to fifteen
years.  Predicting a rapid decline in computing costs, they spent that
time developing and exploring the kinds of learning environments that
would be possible when there was general public access to inexpensive
computers.

Under the guidance of MIT Professor Seymour Papert, the working
philosophy of LOGO's developers has been "No threshold, no ceiling."
Any student should be able to learn in a LOGO learning laboratory and
the gifted student could exploit the open-ended possibilities made
available in this environment.  During the past twelve years,
researchers at MIT and elsewhere have worked with hundreds of
elementary and middle school students of a range of ages, interests
and abilities.  They have developed activities which have the dual
attributes of capturing and holding a child's interest and providing a
rich intellectual environment to further the child's learning.  While
students as young as five and six have successfully learned to use
aspects of LOGO, the usual starting age has been about eight or nine,
the age when most students can begin to be comfortable with a computer
keyboard.  At the other extreme, LOGO has been used with extremely
bright high school and college students.  As a programmer gains
experience with LOGO, she can carry out complex programming projects,
just as with any other high level programming language. (Papert, 1973;
Abelson and diSessa, 1976)

During the past several years, the LOGO group at MIT, part of MIT's
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and its Division for Study and
Research in Education, has been concerned with facilitating the use of
these methods by educators and by the general public.  In l977-78, a
computer laboratory was established at the Lincoln School in Brookline
as part of a research project sponsored by the National Science
Foundation.  (Papert, et al., 1977) All of the school's sixth grade
students were given the opportunity to learn LOGO during twenty to
thirty-six hours of individual computer access.  The learning
experiences of sixteen of the students representing a full range of
ability, were carefully documented and formed the basis for the final
report of the project.  (Papert, et al., 1979) The report details both
the subject matter learned by the students, and the individual
learning paths of each of the sixteen students.  It was a major
finding of the report that the LOGO learning environment had had
significant impact on the education of exceptional students, at both
ends of the spectrum of ability.  In particular, learning disabled
students made dramatic growth in both skills and motivation. Karl,
described above, and Tina were the prime examples:
.twinch 5

1Tina is another severely learning disabled student who participated in
the research project as a sixth grader.  Tina expressed a persistent
interest in using the computer as a typewriter, rather than in
programming it.  She was given the opportunity to use a simple text
editor, which allowed her to write letters and stories, by typing them
on the computer keyboard.  If she made an error in her typing she
could go back and rub it out, editing her work as she saw fit.  When
her work was complete, she used the computer to make as many printed
copies as she wanted, each one looking like a professionally typed
document.  Starting with a two line letter to her mother, Tina
gradually increased her output until she was spending an hour at a
time on a story, and writing stories that powerfully reflected her
interests and feelings.  (See Appendix III for a sample of Tina's
work.)

When the computer teacher sought samples of her creative writing from
her classroom teachers and her learning disabilities tutor, he found
that Tina had not done any creative writing during the entire school
year, and was extremely resistant to school work in general.  Using
the computer, Tina was not only writing, but was proud of her work,
making many copies of each story and distributing them to her family,
friends and teachers.  Tina's blossoming as a writer has continued
even after the computer classses terminated.  During the following two
years she has continued to think of herself as a writer, and has
written and illustrated several small books. (Papert, et al., 1979)

0III.  A Teacher's Perspective

Clearly, something important is happening here.  In the year and a
half since the end of the research project, the Brookline Public
School System has been conducting its own Pilot LOGO Project at Lincoln
School.  Two computers have been placed in various classrooms, and
children have been allowed access to computers on an individual basis.
Because of the original success of learning disabled students with
LOGO, one of the classrooms involved in the Pilot LOGO Project has
been the school's Learning Center.  In June, l979, Karl and Tina's
Learning Center teacher, Ellie Shacter, submitted the following
report to Jeff Resnick, Brookline's Special Education Supervisor:

.ce
Use of the LOGO Computer in the Learning Center

The LOGO computer was designed so students could do their own computer
programming.  Students control the computer, decide what to do and 
then carry it out; they are in charge and can make things happen.

They are able to succeed without having to rely on building up
deficient academic skills.

In learning to program the LOGO Computer, students are:

.indent 6
.undent 2
- learning an approach to thinking which will eventually allow
them to program other computers;
.undent 2
- gaining understanding which, at least, enables them to live
more comfortably in a technological age.
.undent 2
- developing logical (mathematical) thinking and problem solving;
.undent 2
- using strategy and variables;
.undent 2
- gaining information about symmetry, design, angles, geometric forms;
.undent 2
- learning to develop and test their own theories.
.indent 0

.adjust
Personal characteristics such as the ability to take independent
action, the ability to sustain interest in a project, increased
self-esteem, and greater self-knowledge about their individual,
personal ways of exploring are fostered.

Students can develop a sense of being empowered as they are able to
make decisions about this particular "educational environment."

Deficit skills can be remediated within a pleasant, challenging
environment (and in conjunction with use of the computer rather than
as separate problems to be solved.)

.indent 6
.undent 2
- Fine motor skills are improved (through the typing).
.undent 2
- Near point reading (of CRT screen messages) is encouraged.
.undent 2
- Short term memory is developed (while students learn
to use a typewriter keyboard and the various logging in and
programming procedures). 
.undent 2
- Students learn to spell the commands.
.undent 2
- Students learn to receive error messages as informational
messages that help them reach their chosen objectives i.e. 
they experience "making mistakes" without "punishment" and gain
information which enables them to move a step closer toward
reaching their goal.
Students can compose, edit, and print-out multiple copies of
letters and stories they have written at the computer
keyboard.
.undent 2
- Students develop direction-giving and direction-following
skills.
.undent 2
- As they gain skill and experience in the use of LOGO,
students can move from concrete to more abstract levels of
thinking.

IV.  A Theoretical Perspective

From a theoretical perspective we would like to raise the following
issues in considering the impact of LOGO activities on learning
disabled students:

1.  It may be that we just hit it lucky--that this is a very localized
phenomenon peculiar to the few individuals studied so far.  It is important,
therefore, to ascertain just what proportion of the learning disabled
population responds to this computer based learning experience; i.e.
to gauge the extent of the phenomenon.

2.  It may be that the felicitous effect observed flows largely from
the fact that working with computers is seen to be a prestigious
event which in itself spurred the children involved to achieve in
ways that had previously been impossible for them.  If this should
turn out to be the case, that would not necessarily be an argument 
against using computers for this population.  Rather it should incline
us towards their use, whilst at the same time forcing us to carefully
document and constrain any claims we may want to make as to the
role of the LOGO computer environment in contributing to student success.

3.  In searching for reasons why learning takes place in some
particular situations, we recall that learning is a complex process,
and the learner will have had to achieve, at the least,
.indent 6
.undent 3
(a)  the mastery of new facts;
.undent 3
(b)  mastery of new procedures and operations connected with those facts.
.undent 3
(c)  knowing when and where to use (a) and (b) in solving a problem,
i.e. the relevance of knowledge.
.undent 3
(d)  knowing that she knows (c), i.e. the self-confidence to
use knowledge.
.adjust
.indent 0

The LOGO work claims to have particular virtues in regard to (b), (c),
and most especially (d), flowing from the nature of the system,
i.e. the interactive graphics and the explicit decomposition  of
problems combine to give rather transparent feedback to promote
the acquisition of this kind of knowledge.  Because of the record
automatically available during the course of this activity, many of the
information processing steps involved in the task are explicitly
available for scrutiny by both the student and his teacher.  (The
student is learning and the teacher is learning about learning.)
Using this system, component skills can be teased out and particular
hypotheses about reasoning strategies can be probed in a relatively
straightforward way.  (For an example of this see Weir, 1979.)

4.  All this should aid in the analysis of just what is going on.
LOGO activities can be both diagnostic and interventionist.  There
is a good deal to indicate that the learning disabled comprise a
heterogeneous category (summarized in Weir, 1979).   Briefly, the	
suggestion is that the development of spatial reasoning and linguistic
ability do not necessarily go hand in hand.  For example, subjects
weak in linguistic skills can have relatively unimpaired or even
highly developed spatial intelligence.  The latter is rarely engaged in
the usual school subjects, and the children whose strengths lie in
this area go unrewarded (until they show their aptitude for mechanical
drawing or industrial arts in the non-academic area).  LOGO has the virtue
of exploiting such spatial skills, allowing their
owners to shine among their peers and to turn such skills to an
academic (mathematical) purpose. On the other hand, for some children, 
the learning problem may lie in exactly this area, viz in an impaired
spatial sense to the point of affecting the scrutiny of letter strings.
Thus the performance on LOGO tasks promises to be of diagnostic aid in the
process of establishing subtypes of learning disability by
providing one basis for a functional specification of such subcategories.

In addition to the development/documentation project described here,
we will be seeking funding for a research oriented project, to be
carried out among the same population of students and teachers.  If
funded, the two projects will function in a mutually supportive
manner, providing a collaborative setting in which fundamental
research and innovative educational development can inform and support
each other.

An important thread of LOGO research during the last five or six years
has been the use of LOGO with students who have physical,
psychological and functional handicaps.  In 1976, one of us (Sylvia Weir)
then affiliated with the Edinburgh LOGO Group in Scotland, documented
the successful use of LOGO with an autistic child (Weir and Emanuel,
1976).  Since June of 1978, Weir has co-directed, with Professor
Seymour Papert of MIT, a research endeavor exploring the effect of
LOGO on students with Cerebral Palsy. (Papert and Weir, 1978; Weir, 1980).
This work seeks to remedy some of the deficiencies
in the learning environment of a Cerebral Palsy victim due to
communication difficulties, and to the lack of concrete manipulative
experiences available to normal children.  With a suitable computer
language, and with appropriate interface devices to reduce typing
difficulties it is hypothesized that a computer based learning
environment such as LOGO can provide both a medium of communication
and a source of concrete learning activities for the student.  Initial
results, with students at the Cotting School for the Physically 
Handicapped in Boston have been extremely encouraging, as well
as providing much new data about the specific developmental deprivations
of Cerebral Palsied students.  (Weir, 1980)  Of special interest is the
development of diagnostic tasks run on a computer graphics screen, thus
making it possible to test the performance ability of severely 
physically handicapped children, something which has been notoriously
difficult to do.

.ce
V.  A Methodology for Supporting Innovation

At the core of this project is a complex learning experience for the
teachers involved.  We would like to suggest that the teachers'
learning can be compared metaphorically to the process of learning to
skate.  A beginning skater goes through three significant stages.  The
first is "hand-holding."  A friend, parent or instructor, goes out on
the ice with the learner, providing her literally with the direct
support she needs to gain confidence, along with specific instructions
and feedback.  The second is the "watch me!" stage.  The new skater
ventures out on the ice alone, but under the watchful gaze of her
teacher, to whom she can return for support when necessary, and from
whom she can get specific feedback and suggestions.  The third stage
is "free skating."  Now the learner is truly on her own, skating
freely without outside support.  From time to time she may seek
instruction in special areas, or work to perfect a particular skill,
but she is essentially free to pursue additional learning at her own
rate and in accordance with her own interests and desires.

We believe that this metaphor is applicable to the process of
integrating a new learning environment such as LOGO into the ongoing
practice of a Learning Center teacher.  Our project plan provides for
a significant amount of direct support to teachers, especially during
the first year of their participation.  In addition to working closely
with each teacher during the "hand-holding" stage, the project will
create materials for teacher use and eventual dissemination, and will
build a supportive network for the project within each school, and
within the community at large.  We believe that these three aspects of
our plan--direct teacher support, development and dissemination of
materials, and the building of a support network--are all vital in
establishing and sustaining the innovation.

The project is designed to initially involve learning centers in five
schools.  During the second year it will expand to serve about 140
special needs students in all eight Brookline elementary schools.  The
successful provision of services to students depends on successful
training and support of the Learning Center teachers.  During the first
year, our activities will focus most strongly on training teachers,
providing the teachers with supportive services and materials, and
documenting student and teacher learning. As teachers gain 
experience in project activities, the project staff will
gradually shift its major focus from training and support
of teachers, to preparation and dissemination of project
documentation.  By the third year of the project, the first five
teachers should be functioning independently, the second group of
three teachers in their second year of participation, will need less
support, and the project staff will be devoting most of its
energy to writing project documents and disseminating information
about the project to interested schools.

Training and support for teachers will be provided in a variety
of ways.

.block 4
1.  Training:

A two week summer workshop at the start of the project will provide
teachers with an understanding of the philosophy and methods of the
project, as well as training in the LOGO computer language and
activities.  By focusing on their own learning during the training,
teachers will be better able to understand their students' learning
experiences.  The relationship between LOGO activities and the needs
of learning disabled students will be thoroughly discussed.
Additional training will be provided in a series of monthly workshops
throughout the year.

.block 4
2.  Materials:

The project staff will provide materials for teachers and students.
Many of these materials already exist or can be adapted for special
needs students.  Others are currently being developed by the MIT LOGO
Group.  Additional materials will be developed by the project staff,
tested by the teachers and students, and revised by the staff.  These
materials will be an important part of the dissemination of the
project's methods to other teachers.

.block 5
3.  Direct Support:

During the first year of a teacher's participation, regular support
will be provided by a resource teacher and by an instructional aide.
The resource teacher will visit classes, observe students and meet with
the teachers to discuss the overall progress of the project and help
with planning for individual students.  The instructional aide will
provide teachers with release time from regular tutorial duties so
that they can participate more fully in project activities.  The
amount of support for experienced teachers will decrease during
the second year as new teachers are added to the project.  During the
third year, it is anticipated that the original teachers will
be functioning independently, with only occasional assistance from 
the project staff.

.block 5
4.  Project Meetings:

Teachers will be released from regular duties for one half-day per
month to attend project meetings.  At these meetings they will receive
additional training, discuss the progress of the project in
their own classes, share and analyze successes and problems with
individual students, and participate with the staff in ongoing project
planning.

.block 5
5.  A Support Network Within the School and the Community:

The instructional aides and student teachers who make up each Learning
Center team will be provided with training so that they can
participate more fully in project activities.  School personnel such
as classroom teachers, pupil support personnel, the school principal
and guidance counselor, will attend at least one orientation workshop
offered by the project staff.  Parents, who play a major role in
supporting each child's Learning Center program will be invited to an
orientation meeting and encouraged to visit classes.  Parents who wish
to volunteer as tutors will be able to receive additional training
from the project staff.  An Advisory Council will be established to help the
project maintain contact with various groups within the school system
and in the community at large.  Information about the project
published in local, regional and national media will help provide
support to the project, as well as informing a wider public, as part
of project dissemination.

.block 9

VI. Goals of the Project

In summary then, the goals of the project are as follows:

.block 4
1.  Student Goals:
To help mildly to moderately learning disabled students, grade 5-8,
who receive remedial services in school Learning Centers, make gains
in the areas of motivation, self confidence, basic skills in math,
reading, spelling and punctuation, creative writing, typing, logical
problem solving, and computer literacy.

.block 4
2.  Teacher Goals:
To help teachers of learning disabled students develop competence and
confidence in educational uses of computers, and the understandings
necessary to integrate those uses appropriately into each student's
individual education plan.
.block 4

3.  Dissemination Goals:
To securely establish the innovative methods of this project in a
supportive context within participating schools; to make other schools
and school systems aware of the project; and to provide documentation,
training and technical assistance to help them make use of the methods
developed here.

.ce
VII.  Evaluation of Project Objectives

Since the project stresses flexibility of approach, and the integration
of computer activities into individual education plans, all students
will not be expected to meet all objectives equally.  An important
aspect of the project will be the development of the best possible
integration of individual student needs, and project activities in
order to meet particular objectives.  The project staff and teachers
will make use of ongoing evaluation of each child's work to make the
best possible match between student needs and project objectives.  For
example, some students may make extensive use of the text-editor, with
reduced emphasis on computer programming.  For others the reverse may
be true.  The overall evaluation will need to take these individual
differences into account.

The evaluation design, to be developed by the project staff and an
evaluation consultant, will make use of previously developed
standardized measures whenever possible.  In other cases, non-standard
measures will have to be found or developed.  Since some of the
student objectives involve indirect effects of the experience (such as
increased self confidence), or types of learning that are not
routinely measured in schools (such as computer programming skills or
problem solving abilities), the development of the evaluation design
will be a critical task to be addressed early in the project.

A unique form of evaluation data available to this project will come
from "dribble files" kept automatically by the computer.  These are detailed,
keystroke by keystroke records of a student's interaction with the
computer.  They are invaluable in the understanding of problem solving
strategies, mathematical and logical reasoning, and frequency and
duration of computer use.  These will be used by project staff and
teachers in ongoing assessment of student progress and to contribute
to the overall evaluation and documentation of the project.

.block 6
.ce
VIII. The Potential Significance of the Project

We believe that the success of this project could have a significant
impact on the use of computers in the education of special needs
students, and on instructional uses of computers in general.  We use
technology to create a teaching/learning environment which goes far
beyond the common concept of a computer as a tutorial or record
keeping device.  We do this by reversing the usual order of things:
whereas conventional Computer Assisted Instruction systems have a
"clever" computer program teaching a "dumb" student, our students
develop an intelligent self image as they learn to teach a "dumb"
computer.  By stressing learner choices within a range of possible
activities we seek to remedy the problem of alienation experienced by
many special needs students, and to accomodate a variety of individual
needs and capabilities.  Finally, with our stress on the process of
teacher training and the development of teacher and student materials
to integrate a new methodology into an ongoing program, we hope that
this project will provide a model for the incorporation of computers
into educational programs at all levels, and for a variety of student
populations.

INTRODUCTION TO LOGO 

0To provide a context for "learning by doing", we link up various
devices to a computer so that a child can, via a computer, "command" an
output device to carry out an action.  One device we have used is a
mechanical "turtle" capable of moving forward or back in a particular
direction (relative to itself) and of rotating about its central axis.
It has a retractible pen on its underside which can be in two states
called PENUP and PENDOWN.

The mechanical turtle can be replaced by a @@@@@@@on a display screen,
and this is made to "act" by typing commands.  At any one time the turtle
is set at a particular place and facing a particular direction.
.block 10
.sp 9
.ce
fig. 1

If the pen is down, then as the turtle moves around, it leaves
a trace, and so arbitrarily complex patterns can be drawn.  For
example, the following commands will cause the turtle to draw figure 2.

There are many paths to take from this point depending on the
individual characteristics of the learner (and of the teacher).  For
example, the set of instructions required to draw a triangle can be
wrapped up into a bundle as a PROCEDURE and given a NAME.  Different
sizes and orientation of triangle can be drawn by introducing a
variable parameter for the procedure.  This immediately leads to the
discovery that other polygonal shapes can be drawn by selecting
appropriate values for the input variables.

Notice that in addition to learning computer programming, the student
is learning mathematical ideas -- he is exploring the notion of
ANGLE, POLYGONS, RECURSION and so on.

Problem Solving

0Repeated calls of the same triangle procedure were named by children
in a LOGO class in the Brookline public school system as:

Complex patterns can be seen as consisting of familiar parts.  For
example a house can be broken into:

This introduces a basic PROBLEM-SOLVING heuristic i.e. break up a
complex problem into its subparts.  The HOUSE procedure can be built up
out of a TRIANGLE sub-procedure and a SQUARE sub-procedure.  Putting
together these procedures produces an unexpected result.

This is because when the triangle was completed the turtle was left
facing in the direction of the arrow.  So this introduces the idea of a
BUG, which can be easily fixed or DEBUGGED because it is so easy to
follow what is happening -- the relation between the action and its
consequence is very explicit.

AN EXAMPLE OF KARL'S WORK

Karl, a learning disabled student referred to in the body of this paper,
engaged in a number of programming projects in which he was able to make use of
and develop his geometric understanding, organizational skill and reasoning
ability.  In the procedure called ACE, for example, Karl made use of 
circle commands which had been provided as tools by his teacher.  RCIRCLE 50
draws a circle of radius 50, in which the Turtle turns to the right as it 
draws the circle.  LCIRCLE 50 draws a circle of radius 50 turning to the left.

The geometric organization of ACE is shown in fig. 7.  In drawing his design,
Karl made use of right/left  and forward/back symmetry and made creative use of
the relationship between the radius and diameter of a circle.

EXAMPLES OF TINA'S WORK

Tina's pattern of computer use was unique among sixteen experimental
subjects in the Brookline study in that she was not interested in Turtle
Geometry and never learned to write her own LOGO procedures.  On the other
hand, Tina established an intense, personal relationship with the computer,
and, using the computer as a text editor and word processor, wrote a series of
stories that represented a major achievement in the area of creative writing.

The letter, HELEN, is representative of Tina's first two attempts to use the
computer for writing:

.nofill
DEAR HELEN HOW ARE YOU IN YOUR NEW HOME.  I AM GOING TO GET YOU SOMETHING
 FOR YOUR NEW HOME AS SOON AS I GET MY MONEY
LOVE TINA

.adjust
In writing this letter Tina regularly asked for spelling and punctuation
help.  She was concerned that it be grammatically correct, and in proper 
form.  A great deal of time was spent making sure each line was correct,
before going on to the next.

Once she shifted from writing letters to stories, Tina became less
concerned with spelling and grammar (although she continued to ask for
help in these areas).  Instead, she was more concerned with the details
of the story:  the names of the characters, the places they lived, the 
sequence of events, and the feelings of the characters involved.  Tina 
had deep feelings about her subject matter.  Her story, SONNY, is typical
of her style and intensity of feeling:

.nofill
SONNY IS A LITTLE BOY HE LIVES WITH HIS AUNT HELEN IN CALIFORNIA 
HE HAS BEEN LIVE WITH HER FOR 9 YEARS.  HE IS GOING TO A HOME FOR
LITTLE WONDERS 4 WEEKS AFTER THAT TO
COUPLE A ADOPTED SONNY HE WAS THE HAPPIEST BOY THAT YOU EVERY
SEEN.  I GUESS IF THAT WAS ME I WOULD BE HAPPY IF SOME ONE WOULD
ADOPT.  BUT SEE I AM NOT ADOPT I HAVE MY ON MOTHER AND I AM
GLAD THAT I HAVE MY ON MOTHER.BECAUSE THE KIDS THAT HAVE FEELS
REALLY BAD.  THAT'S WHY ALL THE KIDS IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL TO THEIR PARENTS.  THE END.

.adjust
After completing each of her stories, Tina printed many copies to be
distributed to her friends, family and teachers.  The widespread 
distribution of her stories was an indication of the pride and 
satisfaction she felt in her work.
