Abstract0


(5)Computers can be used by the physically handicapped in many ways, including as an 
educational aid and as a therapeutic device.
A method has been proposed which permits
multiple input devices to replace or complement the use of the keyboard.  A Multiple Input
System is described which relies on the existence of a device called a Multiple Input
Communicator (MIC).  MIC would be able to accept the multiple inputs and convert them
into a stream of bits which would appear as if they had been generated from a terminal at
the computer's point of view.  In order to investigate MIC's feasibility, a Multiple Input
Device System was designed and a simulation of its behavior was implemented on the LISP
Machine.

.chapter "Background and Motivation"

.nr chapter_starts_page 0
(5)Physically disabled but mentally alert individuals today often face
a bleak future. Their handicaps force them into passive roles
and deprive them of opportunities to increase learning.
They have few occupational alternatives.  Those who are non-vocal
experience tremendous frustration since they have difficulty communicating or
cannot communicate their thoughts and  questions to others.

(5)Computer systems have great potential to free such people
from passive roles, to let them inquire and gain knowledge, to
open more occupational alternatives, and to bring greater promise to
their futures.
A computer can be filled with information which the physically handicapped
can investigate with a query language designed to meet their needs.  Text
editors would enable the handicapped to write, improving their communication
skills by allowing them to practice spelling and grammar.
With LOGO, an interactive graphics, computer-based
learning environment, the initiative and control of tasks is left
completely to the user.  Learning in this manner could give these individuals
new self-confidence as well as the opportunity to gain experience in programming techniques.  

(5)In order to reap these and other benefits, the handicapped user
must first be able to communicate with the computer.  Current techniques
by which computer users transmit their requests to a
machine are
generally unsuitable for use by a handicapped person.  The most common
method, typing instructions at a teletype keyboard, cannot be
used by handicapped people lacking the motor ability to type.
A method currently being developed with some success involves voice and
speech recognition; unfortunately, such a method is of no help
to non-vocal individuals.  Some other computer input system
which would accommodate non-vocal people with severe physical limitations
is therefore desireable.

(5)There are several other points that should be remembered while developing this system.
For maximum practicality, the system
should be adaptable to several different physical handicaps.  This
will increase the number of people who might benefit from the design.
Also, the cost of the system should be considered
since many people who might be able to use the system will not purchase
the product or obtain the benefits of it if the cost is
excessive.  The philosophy behind LOGO dictates that the input
system remain user initiated:  the user  will actively pick and input
the requests rather than stop a pointer when the desired request has
been chosen by the computer.

(5)A multiple input device system
in which device definitions and capabilities could be easily altered to fit
the particular needs of any individual would meet the above considerations.
Such a system has been designed, permitting up to eight input devices
to be used.  Devices would be placed, selected, and defined to meet the special needs
of the given user, and the signals generated by these devices would be transmitted to
a Multiple Input Communicator (MIC).  The MIC would process these signals
to determine the equivalent stream a teletype would pass to a computer
and then, imitating the teletype, the MIC sends this stream on to the computer

(5)The intentions of my work are these:  (1) To investigate the utility
of a Multiple Input System as an aid to handicapped
computer users; and (2) To design a Multiple Input System providing access
to all capabilities of the LOGO environment for one particular
subject.



.chapter "Previous Work and Available Literature"

(5)Although no work has been done previously to develop a multiple
input system for use by the handicapped, there is some literature available
which shows the feasibility of such a system and suggests that these
developments should prove beneficial.

(5)Papert and Weir [1,2,3]  are investigating the way people afflicted with cerebral palsy
think about the space around them and how they conceptualize that space.  One idea they are
investigating is that cerebral palsy-afflicted people have trouble with this type of
thinking because their disability restricts them from the freedom to explore the world
around them as others can.  A large amount of current LOGO work at the Massachusetts
Hospital School in Canton, MA involves testing the spatial knowledge of students afflicted
with cerebral palsy.   Students who were unable to type, a skill needed to take the exams,
were required to "type" using headsticks.  A headstick is a plastic-tipped metal rod attached
to headgear and strapped around the chin of the student.  Since this method of typing is
very inaccurate, a clear plastic key guard was developed.  This guard was placed over the
keyboard so that the subject would be likely to strike plastic rather than an incorrect key
if the position of the headstick was not quite accurate.  This resulted in a significant 
reduction in the number of keys hit unintentionally.

(5)Papert and Weir [3] conducted a pilot study at the Cotting School for
Handicapped Children in Boston, MA.  The results of this study showed
that LOGO, a computer-based learning environment, could help
educate and rehabilitate severely handicapped students.
In one instance, a boy afflicted with cerebral palsy,
serious speech problems and athetoid movements changed dramatically
after working with LOGO.  He was transformed from a quiet non-participant
into a leader at school.  His self-worth rose dramatically, as did his self-confidence.
He also developed facility in geometry and in programming processes.  He was recently
accepted into a college to study programming.

(5)Such benefits are slow in coming and generally not quite as spectacular.  However, many
students exposed to LOGO develop a higher sense of personal worth.  This additude change is
probably due at least in part to LOGO's environment which places initiative and control in
hands of the user; this gives students high motivation  to learn.  Students at Cotting School
showed accelerated learning in areas where improvements were not thought possible and, 
surprisingly, even developed better control over fine motor movements as their typing
improved.  This suggests that the potential therapeutic benefits of computer exposure are
great.

(5)Many students experienced a great deal of difficulty in typing, making the need for
specially
designed keyboards or input systems permitting parts of the body other than the fingers
to generate signals apparent.  The concept of a "Button Box", an input device with large keys
separated by a greater distance and defined to reduce the number of gestures needed when
making a Turtle request in the LOGO Graphics environment, was introduced.  The suggestion was
made that the number of required gestures could be similarly reduced by redefining the present
teletype keys via software techniques.

(5)Sweeney [4] has proposed a flexible Multiple Input  System which would permit input
signals to
be accepted from up to eight input devices rather than from the single teletype keyboard.
These devices may be strategically placed to allow different parts of the body to activate
generation of signals through them.  The signals are sent in the form of a bit stream to a
Multiple Input Communicator (MIC), the crux of the system design.  MIC is a data driven
program which is achieved here as a program on a separate microprocessor. as suggested by
Vanderheiden [5].  Basically, MIC acts as am interpreter.  He listens to the Multiple Input
Devices and translates from their "language" to the "language" a computer would expect from a
keyboard.  The substitution from keyboard to Multiple Input Devices and MIC can be seen in 
Figure 1.
.begin_page_figure "Normal and Multiple Input Device Configurations"
.finish_figure
(5)In cases where the
computer has multi-process capability, MIC could be realized as one process on the machine.
On a larger computer, MIC could be a subroutine which handles input to the computer.
The bit stream provides information about the device which generated it.  Based on this
information, MIC will decide how to interpret the remaining bits.  Using this analysis, MIC
will produce a single stream which serves as the input stream to the computer.

.chapter "The LOGO Learning Environment"

(5)In addition to providing the standard mathematical problem solving
tools, the following capabilities are found in the LOGO Learning
Environment.
         
     -  Graphics.  A powerful set of primitive graphics commands 
        are provided.  This area is referred to as the LOGO
        Turtle World.
     -  Editor.  Standard line editor facilities are provided.
     -  String Manipulations.  LOGO provides standard string
        manipulations for general problem solving.

.chapter "Observations of Handicapped Students at Cotting School"
0

(5)Observations of handicapped students working in the LOGO environment were conducted
at the Cotting School for Handicapped Children.  Several students displayed awkward movements
and speech problems that often are apparent in cases of cerebral palsy.  
These problems often make communicating with computers difficult, yet some of Cotting
School's students obtained tremendous therapeutic benefits from using the computer.
In one instance, a student who had previously been willing to let his left hand lie helplessly
at his side began using this hand to press down the control key.  Since some
edit commands require that the control key and a character key be pressed simultaneously,
developing this skill meant he could communicate editing commands independently, without
instructor assistance.  It seems that therapeutic benefits like this are likely to occur,
since there is a high motivation here to acquire improved motor skill and coordination.  As a
result, a student may work more diligently towards this goal as a result.

(5)These observations clearly showed that the standard
keyboard-type of input device is difficult for many handicapped people to use.
The existence of the "delete" key,
which can forgive many mistakes, is an aid.  Unfortunately, this one
key is not enough to sufficiently reduce the frustration experienced
by more severely handicapped users who hit many, many
incorrect keys.  More aids designed specifically for handicapped users
are needed.


.chapter "Development of a Multiple Input System Design"

(5)Although all the students at Cotting School had enough fine motor
coordination to type with some degree of accuracy, there are many very
severely handicapped individuals who lack the needed coordination and would not be able to type at all.
Also, there are quite a few people who, like the student mentioned
above, lack needed typing skills in one hand and who therefore are
unable to take full advantage of the power of the computer.
LOGO group leaders had users in these categories in mind when
they began encouraging the development of a Multiple Input System.

(5)Based on these observations, an investigation was conducted to determine the number of
input devices that a handicapped individual who could not type would need.
Even a person who could use a headstick with some accuracy would still
need an alternative means of communicating control characters to the computer
(these characters require two keys to be pressed simultaneously).
An additional device would be needed which could either: (a) contain the
set of all control characters or (b) signal the MIC that the next
character entered at the keyboard should be converted into a control character
before being passed into the computer input stream.

(5)Also, although a user with a headstick is theoretically capable of
typing any commands using the present keyboard (excluding control-character commands), in practical use, 
this method is long, tedious, and prone to error.  This suggests a need for
two more device types.  One is a delete (rubout) device which should
be chosen and placed so that the handicapped user could somehow activate the
device easily.  The other is a sort of "shorthand keyboard" which would 
substitute one or a short sequence of keys for long commands consisting of 
long character strings.  The investigation suggested development of a system consisting
of three to five input devices:  keyboard, control, rubout, and possibly
one or two command (shorthand) keyboards.

(5)Observations of one handicapped student were conducted
with the goal of designing a system to meet his particular needs.
Louie, a fourteen year old boy afflicted with
cerebral palsy, is a student at the Massachusetts Hospital School in Canton,
MA.  Louie is quadriplegic and non-vocal; he cannot type and possesses limited control over
body movements.
However, he has relatively good control over motions of his head.
Louie regularly communicates by pointing with his nose to words or letters on
a board attached to his wheelchair.  He knows how to use a headstick
and is relatively accurate when typing on a teletype keyboard with it when the clear
plastic guard is placed over the keyboard.

(5)Louie was observed using the headstick
during spatial knowledge testing of cerebral palsy afflicted youngsters
by members of the LOGO group.  Further work was conducted with Louie to discover the
areas of his body over which Louie possessed greater motor control and
coordination and problems Louie had with headstick typing which needed
to be resolved.  It was determined that Louie use a headstick on a keyboard device
in the system being designed
because Louie's familiarity with the keyboard-headstick combination
outweighed difficulties asociated with the method:  the fact that Louie could 
already manipulate the headstick would enable him to learn the entire
system more rapidly.  

(5)The best way to take advantage of Louie's familiarity
with the headstick and keyboard while minimizing problems caused by his
inaccuracy at typing with the headstick would be to 
limit the number of "active" keys on the teletype keyboard.  
In other words, the computer was to perform no action when "inactive"
keys were pressed.  This way, if Louie were to make an error
and hit the wrong key, there would be a good chance that the
mistake would be ignored by the computer.  By spreading the active keys
across the whole face of the keyboard, the odds that a key hit
accidentally would produce no action could be increased.

(5)Limiting the number of active keys meant Louie would be unable
to access all computer capabilities through the keyboard.  It was proposed that a good
compromise would be to have active keys result in the performance of LOGO Turtle
primitive commands or serve as arguments to such commands.
This allowed Louie to work on the computer with his headstick while the
rest of the system was being defined.  Figure 1 shows the
selection of active keys and the corresponding actions or values.
The set of programs I called Board1 defines this and is listed in
Appendix A.  LOGO Turtle primitive commands are briefly described in Appendix 
B.
.begin_page_figure "Board1 Setup."
.finish_figure

(5)Restricting the keyboard solely to Turtle commands meant other
devices would be needed to access the other LOGO capabilities.
However, additional devices increase the cost of the system as well as
the time required to obtain parts for the system.
The best way to minimize the complications resulting
from additonal devices was to offer alternative definitions of the
teletype keyboard.
The particular definition in effect at any given time would be determined
by another input device.
				    
(5)This Keyboard Definition Device (KDD) would either run the Board1 Turtle World
definition or it would run the standard keyboard definition.
When the system was turned on, the standard keyboard definition
would be in effect.
By activating this KDD, the program which restricts the user to the Turtle 
World would begin.  Pushing this button again would terminate the program.

(5)In addition to the keyboard and the KDD, two more devices are
added to the system.
The first is a Control Character Device (CCD) which will tell MIC
that the next character typed at the keyboard should be converted
into a control character in the output stream.  The last device
is a Delete Device (DEL).  This is provided to simplify correcting errors as an
alternative to the delete key provided on the keyboard.

.chapter "Placement of the Multiple Input Devices"

(5)From earlier work with Louie, it was observed that his hands were very strong, but very
poorly coordinated.  Also, it was noted that Louie was very proficient at using his nose as
a pointer.  Unfortunately, nose-activated devices could not be provided:  the headstick would
get in the way.  Therefore, movements that Louie would not find excessively difficult to make
were sought as were corresponding locations that were relatively accessible yet unlikely to be
activated accidentally.  Button type devices would be preferred over any other because they
are easy to operate and easy to purchase.  The upright metal bars supporting the armrests on
Louie's wheelchair were found to be suitable locations, meeting all the above requirements.  
A third location chosen was beside the teletype keyboard.  This could be activated either by
hand or headstick.  The DEL and KDD buttons were placed on the wheelchair, and the table
location was selected for the control character.  The main reason for this selection is that
it would permit converting CCD from a one button, single signal generating device to a
multi-button, multi-signal generating device relatively easily.  Thus, rather than have to
type CCD G for control-G, one key might do it all.  The present setup of devices is pictured
in Figure 2.

.chapter "Limitations Imposed on the Implemented System"

     These are Limitations on the implemented system:
          - Access is limited to the Turtle World
          - Additional input devices were not implemented

1
.section "The Turtle World Limitation"
0

(5)The number of keys on the teletype keyboard was defined under Board1
was limited to eighteen:  seven keys are the basic seven Turtle commands and the other
eleven keys are ten numerical values (5, 10, 20, 30, ..., 90) which serve as arguments to 
some of the
commands and a "cancel command" key.  These numerical values were chosen since they permit
any figure desired to be drawn relatively accurately.  The remaining keys were left
undefined.  This limitation was entered because the area of the LOGO Project
which is currently of greatest interest involves exploring the ability of the
cerebral palsy afflicted to think spatially.  A brief description of the
Turtle and Turtle Commands is given in Appendix B.  This restricts
Louie's use of the computer to the Turtle World until MIC is completed, 
but it has simplified communication with the computer.   This allows Louie to learn to work
on the computer and to practice using the headstick.  It is important that the task of
communicating with the computer not be too difficult so that users like
Louie will not become overly discouraged.

(5)With this idea of greatly simplifying communication in mind, a
second guard
was constructed of cardboard and placed over the clear plastic guard.
This covered keys that have no effect under Board1, and
prevented Louie from accidentally hitting these keys.

1
.section "Failure to Implement All Input Devices"
0

(5)The Multiple Input Communicator (MIC) which permits the developments of multiple input
device systems is not yet debugged.  Therefore, it was not possible to implement the
additional buttons described in my design.

.chapter "Simulation of MIC"

(5)In order to insure the feasibility of the Multiple Input Communicator, a program
was written to simulate the logic behind the designed input system.  This programming
was done on the LISP Machine in Technology Square.  

1
.section "Overview of MIC"
0

(5)A Multiple Input Communicator (MIC) is a device which serves as an interface
between a computer system and a handicapped user.  MIC compensates for the afflicted 
user's inability to effectively user conventional input devices (teletypewriters,
for example) by accepting signals from several "special" input devices, translating 
these signals into commands or sequences of commands acceptable to the computer, and 
then transmitting the results to the host system.  These special input devices are
most frequently switches of various kinds positioned in a manner designed to take
advantage of what motor control the handicapped user may possess:  a single motion
of the user's body can invoke a complex process within the host system.  These 
processes are defined to suit the user's needs and can be modified as he or she becomes
more sophisticated in using the system.  

(5)Currently, MIC is visualized as a microprocessor, although different implementations are
possible and seem likely.  On systems capable of supporting multiple processes, for
example, MIC could be implemented as a process which handles input for the handicapped
user.  A wide variety of forms combining different amounts of "hardware" and "software"
may be conceived for MIC.  The flexibility of the idea renders it adaptable for 
virtually any handicapped person.  

1
.section "Discussion of the Model"
0

(5)We shall model MIC as a "black box" which has the following properties:
.in +12
1.  Standard ASCII characters are accepted in the form of binary strings;
these are transmitted to the computer without modification.

2.  Signals are accepted from three special devices which shall result in special 
behavior.  One device will send a delete character symbol to the host system.
A second will tell MIC to transform the next character received into a control character
and transmit it to the computer.  The third device will send a string of binary characters
which will activate or terminate a program which enables single keystrokes to be
interpreted as 
Turtle commands.
                      
.in -12

(5)A character is represented in the model as a list of eight "bits"  (0's and 1's).
A word then corresponds to a list of characters or list of lists.  Standard ASCII 
character code is used.  

(5)Input is received from the keyboard one character at a time.  Each character is read 
with the LISP primitive TYI which returns the ASCII value (octal) for the next character
typed at the keyboard.  This value is stored away to be examined or changed later.
If the examination indicates that a special button has been depressed, then 
a corresponding special number that will be recognized by the functions representing
MIC will be saved.  Depending on the values received by these functions, certain values
will be determined to be sent on to the computer stream.

The source code is provided in Appendix C, along with further explanation of the program.

.chapter "Problems"
0

(5)There were a few problems encountered during the course of the project.
The original student that had been selected for my system design developed a neck problem 
that made using a headstick impossible.
I needed to find another subject and was very fortunate to find Louie.

(5)The computers that I have been using at Canton has been troublesome.
The present keyboard is undependable, being very sensitive to
humidity and temperature.  An earlier DEC 3500 developed extremely neurotic
behavior and was finally sent in for repairs.
The original plan had been to use an Apple computer; it was scrapped since LOGO's
3500 was in Massachusetts Hospital School for other purposes.  When this
machine broke, it was necessary to borrow one from the Cotting
School.  This computer failure was not greatly detrimental to the development
of the Multiple Input System.  However, it hindered the final evaluation
of the modified keyboard; the user needed to become fully acquainted with the working in the
LOGO Turtle Environment before its true effectiveness could be reported.

(5)I was disappointed that MIC was not completed in time to be used in my project.
Although it  was not expected to be completed, the absence of the device limited the bulk of
this project to theory rather than implementation.
Nonetheless, this project has been an enjoyable as well as a useful one.

.chapter "Suggestions for Future Work"

(5)The work done with Louie was promising.  Although Louie experienced some problems
typing accurately even the modified version of the keyboard, he quickly acquired
enough ability to draw simple figures and write his name.  Since Louie was aware that other
computer activities were being performed for him (such as login in and out), he expressed
a desire to also be able to perform these actions.  The Multiple Input Device System 
described in this paper should enable him to accomplish this.  For this reason,
this system should be implemented.
There are many other ways that the system could have been designed,
but the simplicity of this design makes it a good choice.

(5)Work needs to be done to eliminate the need for the cumbersome headstick.
This will require that the physical abilities of Louie or other handicapped individuals
be studied carefully and that devices to meet these abilities be developed.
For example, Louie has expressed a desire to be able to signal a computer
request with his nose instead of a headstick.  I was unable to find a
method to do this, since the keys on the teletype are too small to hit with
a nose. However, a nose device might still be worth investigating
since Louie is very good at pointing to characters on his 
communication board with his nose.
(5)Finally, the encouraging results of work done with Louie suggest that using Multiple 
Input Device Systems as a therapeutic tool needs to be considered while
the successful results of work ddevelop this specific instance of such a system can be applied when considering
other systems in the future.  It must not be forgotten that the goal of the system is to
simplify communication with the computer using whatever means the handicapped user can.

.chapter "Appendix B:  Turtle and Turtle Commands"


Turtles come in many species, but the one used in my project is
the "display turtle".  The display turtle looks like this:     



      The head is pointing upwards.  This turtle "lives" on the video screen and
can be manipulated with the following commands:


     LEFT NUM
     RIGHT NUM
     FORWARD NUM
     BACK NUM
     PENUP
     PENDOWN
     CLEARSCREEN


LEFT and RIGHT will turn the turtle in the specified direction
by NUM degrees.
FORWARD and BACK move the turtle in the specified direction by NUM units.
PENUP and PENDOWN determine whether a trace will be left when the turtle
moves (PENDOWN) or not (PENUP).
CLEARSCREEN removes all earlier traces made and returns the turtle to
its "origin":  facing upward in the center of the screen.

;; may be conceived for MIC.  The flexibility of the idea renders it adaptable for 
;; virtually any handicapped person.  

;;DISCUSSION OF THE MODEL

;; We shall model MIC as a "black box" which has the following properties:
;;        1.  Standard ASCII characters are accepted in the form of binary strings;
;;            these are transmitted to the computer without modification.
;;        2.  Signals are accepted from three special devices:  BUTTON1, BUTTON2, and
;;            BUTTON3.  These signals shall have the following meanings:
;;                BUTTON1 - Send a delete character (binary) to the host system.
;;                BUTTON2 - Transform the next character received into a control character
;;                          and transmit it to the computer.
;;                BUTTON3 - Send a string of binary characters which activates BOARD1
;;                          (a subset of the LOGO "Turtle World" graphics environment)
;;                          if this program has not been invoked.  Or, if BOARD1 is currently
;;                          being executed, sent a STOP CHARACTER string to the computer.

;; A character is represented in the model as a list of eight "bits"  (0's and 1's).
;; A word then corresponds to a list of characters or list of lists.  Standard ASCII 
;; character code is used.  

;; Input is received from the keyboard one character at a time.  Each character is read 
;; with the LISP primitive TYI which returns the ASCII value (octal) for the next character
;; typed at the keyboard.  This value is stored in INPUT_BUFFER, which is examined by the
;; function CHECK_INPUT_BUFFER.  If the value of INPUT_BUFFER indicates that a special
;; button has been depressed (ASCII values (octal) 133, 135, 137 corresponding to the
;; characters "[" (BUTTON1), "]" (BUTTON2), and "_" (BUTTON3), respectively), then BUFFER is
;; assigned a corresponding special number (301, 302, or 304) which is recognized by the
;; functions MIC and SPECIAL_DEVICES as a button.  The value of BUFFER is then converted
;; into a "character" via the functions CONVERT and EXPLODE_NUMBER:  MIC_BUFFER is assigned
;; this value.  The function MIC then examines MIC_BUFFER.  If the value is a button, control
;; transfers to the function SPECIAL_DEVICES which executes the appropriate action.
;; Otherwise, OUTPUT_STREAM is assigned the value of MIC_BUFFER.  Transmission of the
;; translated input to the computer is represented by printing the value of OUTPUT_STREAM.

;;GLOBAL VARIABLES
;; input_buffer holds octal representation of keyboard characters from the keyboard.
;; buffer holds octal representation which will be sent to mic
;; button1,
;; button2,
;; and button3 hold octal representations of keyboard characters which serve to represent
;;             the additional input devices 
;; anmic_buffer
;; delete_stringherwise, board1_flag is set off
