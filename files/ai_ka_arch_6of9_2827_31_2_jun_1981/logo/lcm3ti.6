Talking to the Turtle0

By Daniel H. Watt

(TI Logo Version)
.sp 6
.ls 1
The turtle is an object that can draw pictures on the TV screen. You can think of the turtle as a "robot" that can move forward and back and
turn right or left. With its pen down, it can draw geometric shapes in color, as it
moves around the screen.
.sp 6
The development of these materials was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number SED - 7919033 and conducted at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Field tests were conducted in the public schools of Brookline, Massachusetts.

.bp

bold(Things to try:)

.fi b
Experiment with the turtle.  Type FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT and LEFT  (or FD, BK, RT, and LT), with a lot of
different input numbers.  Try very large and very small inputs.

.nf L
Make the turtle draw a square.  Or a rectangle.  Or a triangle.

Make the turtle draw your initials

Make an unplanned drawing using a variety of turtle commands.

.fi b
Find the size of the turtle's screen.  

(If you tell the turtle to go too far, it will disappear at one edge of the screen and reappear at the oposite edge, to continue drawing its line. This is called wrapping around the screen. If you tell the turtle to draw too many lines, the computer will print an error message:  OUT OF INK.)

.nf l
Pick a point on the screen and move the turtle there.

.chapter "bold(Teaching the Computer a New  Command Using the Logo Procedure Editor)"
.fi b

You can teach the computer to remember a particular series of steps
by defining a procedure. When you type   TO   followed by a name that you have
chosen, the computer changes to edit mode. While you are editing, the computer does not carry out your commands, but just stores them until you finish editing. Here's what you do:
.nf l

Type   TO   followed by a name.
Type the   <ENTER>  key to clear a new line.
Then type each step in order.  
To stop using the editor, type   <SHIFT> - Z.
(Hold down the key marked   <SHIFT> and type  Z  at the same time.)

.fi b
For more information about using the editor, read booklet II - bold(Using the Logo Operating System).

.nf L
Here are some examples you can try:

TO    FUN		t(m)TO    BOX
FORWARD    30  t(m)FORWARD    20
RIGHT    120 t(m)RIGHT    90
FORWARD    10 t(m)FORWARD    20
LEFT    90 t(m)RIGHT    90
BACK    20 t(m)FORWARD    20
END t(m)RIGHT    90
		t(m)FORWARD    20
		t(m)RIGHT    90
		t(m)END


.fi b
You can use any name that is not already a LOGO command or the name of a procedure
you have already defined.   The steps of the
procedure can be any other LOGO commands or procedures.  When you type the command, FUN or
BOX, the computer will carry out your sequence of steps.

bold(Things to try:)

.nf L
Type the command,  FUN,  or  BOX,  several times.
.fi b
Teach the computer to draw a smaller square, a rectangle, triangle, or any
other shape you know how to draw.
.br
Invent a new shape, by choosing a number of different commands at random.


.bp
bold(Notes about the Logo Screen Editor)

If you want to change a procedure for any reason, type  EDIT    followed by the procedure name. This will return the computer to edit mode, with your procedure displayed on the screen ready for you to edit. When you are finished editing your procedure type:

	   <SHIFT> - Z

You can use all the special editing keys to make changes in your procedure:

bold(Commands to Move the Cursor)
 
.nf L
	<SHIFT> - 			s(m)moves cursor up one line

	<SHIFT> - 			t(m)moves cursor down one line

	<SHIFT> - 			t(m)moves cursor left one space

	<SHIFT> - 			t(m)moves the cursor right one space

	<SHIFT> - V	t(m)moves cursor to end of line.

	<SHIFT> - W	t(m)moves cursor to beginning of line.

bold(Editing Commands)

	<SHIFT> - F			t(m)erases the character at the cursor.

	<SHIFT> - T				t(m)erases the character behind the cursor,	
				t(m)just as it does when you are typing
				t(m)normal LOGO commands.

	<SHIFT> - C	t(m)erases an entire line
	t(m)to the right of the cursor.
	
	<ENTER>                     t(m)creates a new line and moves the cursor 
                                        t(m)down to the beginning of the new line.
				t(m)If there is any text to the right
				t(m)of the cursor it will be moved too.

<SHIFT> - W    <ENTER>		t(m)this combination can be used to
				t(m)create a blank line.
.chapter "bold(How the Turtle Uses Its Pen)"
When you first type  DRAW,  the Turtle always starts with its pen down.  This
means that it draws lines whenever it is commanded to move forward or back.

.nf L
You can change what the turtle's pen does:

PENUP    or    PU t(m)The turtle will not draw lines when it moves.

PENDOWN    or    PD t(m)The turtle will draw lines whenever it moves.

PENERASE    or    PE t(m)the turtle will erase existing lines
	t(m)as it moves.

PENREVERSE  or  PR  t(m)the turtle will erase any existing lines, and,
		t(m)draw lines where there are none.

.keep
.nf l

Using  SETCOLOR   (or   SC)  the turtle can draw in any of sixteen colors.
	
	SETCOLOR   :CLEAR		s(n)or   SETCOLOR   0
	SETCOLOR   :BLACK	t(n)or   SETCOLOR   1
	SETCOLOR   :GREEN	t(n)or   SETCOLOR   2
	SETCOLOR   :LIME		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   3
	SETCOLOR   :BLUE		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   4

	SETCOLOR   :ORANGE		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   9
	SETCOLOR   :YELLOW		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   10
	SETCOLOR   :LEMON		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   11
	SETCOLOR   :OLIVE		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   12
	SETCOLOR   :PURPLE		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   13
	SETCOLOR   :GRAY		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   14
	SETCOLOR   :WHITE		t(n)or   SETCOLOR   15

.end_keep
.keep
.fi b

SETCOLOR   or   SC   can also be used with a list of two input numbers. This will color the background of each tile on which the turtle draws with the color given by the second input.

Example:     SETCOLOR   [ 1  15 ]

This will cause the turtle to draw black lines on white squares.


COLORBACKGROUND   or   CB   will change the entire background, to whatever color you choose.
.nf l

Examples:

	COLORBACKGROUND   :YELLOW
	CB   10
.fi b

To erase any line on the screen, just draw over it with the pen set  to erase by typing   PENERASE  or  PE,  before moving the turtle.

.chapter "bold(Drawing Circles and Arcs)"
.fi b


Many interesting designs can be drawn using circles and arcs. The turtle can draw a circle by going forward a little and turning a little, and repeating the same steps over and over until it has returned to its starting place.


.section "bold(Procedures for drawing circles and arcs)"
You can teach the computer a set of procedures that draw circles and arcs.
RCIRCLE  and  LCIRCLE draw 12-sided polygons that look enough like circles to be useful for most turtle drawings.  RARC and  LARC  are used to draw  quarter circles.  If your disk does not already have the circle and arc procedures on it, you will have to carefully copy the procedures given.

.keep

RCIRCLE and LCIRCLE, RARC and LARC are used with an input giving the radius of the circle or arc you are drawing.


.nf L
RCIRCLE    20  t(m)Draws a circle of radius 20, curving to the right.
.sp 4
LCIRCLE    10 t(m)Draws a circle of radius 10, curving to the left.
.sp 4
RARC    20 t(m)Draws a quarter circle of radius 20, curving 
	  t(m)to the right.
.sp 4
LARC    10 t(m)Draws a quarter circle of radius 10, curving
	  t(m)to the left.
.end_keep
.fi b
.keep
If you do not already have circle and arc procedures on your disk, carefully copy all the following procedures. (To type square brackets   [   and   ],    type  <SHIFT> - 4   and  <SHIFT> - 5.)

The following procedures can be used to draw circles and arcs curving to the right.

.nf L
TO    RCIRCLE    :R t(m)RCIRCLE   stands for "right circle."
REPEAT    12    [RCP    :R] t(m)Twelve repeats of the subprocedure RCP make
END				t(m) a complete "circle" of radius  :R
				t(m)curving to the right.

TO    RCP    :R  t(m)RCP draws one "circle piece" curving to the 
RIGHT    15       t(m)right.  :R stands for the radius of the circle.
FD    :R / 2
RIGHT    15
END


TO    RARC   :R t(m)RARC draws a quarter circle arc
REPEAT    3    [RCP   :R]	t(m)curving to the right.
END

The following procedures can be used to draw circles and arcs curving to the left.
.nf L

REPEAT    12   [ LCP  :R ]		t(m)curving to the left.

.fi b

Turtle procedures which draw shapes can be used to build more complex 
shapes.  Here are some examples.

You might start with two procedures.  One draws a box, and the other a triangle:

.nf L
.keep
TO    BOX t(m)TO    TRIANGLE
FORWARD    30 t(m)LEFT    90
RIGHT    90 t(m)FORWARD    30
FORWARD    30 t(m)RIGHT    120
RIGHT    90 t(m)FORWARD    30
FORWARD    30 t(m)RIGHT    120
RIGHT    90 t(m)FORWARD    30
FORWARD    30 t(m)END
END
.end_keep

.fi b
You could build other designs from them, by repeating them
and combining them in different ways.  You can often make interesting designs 
in this way.

.nf L

For example,

TO    WINDOW
BOX

Putting a box and a triangle together, you can construct a house:


.nf L

and, repeating HOUSE four times,
.sp 4
TO   HOUSE4
HOUSE

.fi b
HOUSE4  and  6BUTTERFLY  can be put together, to make a new design,

.nf L
TO    HB46
HOUSE4
6BUTTERFLY
END
.sp 10
.end_keep

.keep
.fi b
HB46 looks something like a spider. If you add some
circles you could make a SPIDER procedure.

.nf L
TO    SPIDER
HB46
RCIRCLE    16
LCIRCLE    16
RCIRCLE    8
LCIRCLE    8
BACK    15
RCIRCLE    4
LCIRCLE    4
END
.sp 4

.fi b
To draw the "spider" you must first teach the computer to draw circles, by defining the procedures  RCIRCLE,  LCIRCLE,  RCP,  and  LCP,  given in section 4.1.
.end_keep
.bp


.section "bold(Building a Planned Shape Using Subprocedures)"

.keep
.fi b
Here is an example of a planned project.  You might want
the turtle to draw a "person" that looked something
like this:
.sp 10
.end_keep
You could draw the person using a long series of turtle commands--
FORWARDs, BACKs, RIGHTs and LEFTs. It would probably be simpler
to solve the problem using subprocedures and a
superprocedure  named PERSON.

.nf L
.keep
TO    PERSON
LEGS
BODY
ARMS
NECK
HEAD
END
.end_keep

.fi b
Teaching the computer five different procedures might seem to be
complicated, but this method offers several advantages.  First, you can
start by planning your whole project in advance, so you know exactly what
you have to do to accomplish your goal.  Second, you can try to solve a series of
small problems, one at a time, rather than one big problem.  Third, when you
want to change one part of your design while leaving the rest of it the same,
it will be easier to decide which commands to change.
.keep

One subprocedure,  VEE,  can be used to draw both the arms and the legs of the person.
.nf L

TO    VEE
RIGHT    45
FORWARD    10    BACK    10
LEFT    90
FORWARD    10    BACK    10
RIGHT    45
END
.end_keep
.keep

Now  use VEE to make procedures for the arms and the legs.

TO    ARMS t(m)ARMS uses VEE directly
VEE
END
.end_keep

.keep
TO    LEGS t(m)LEGS reverses the turtle's direction before
RIGHT    180		t(m)using VEE, then reverses the turtle again so that
VEE		t(m)it ends up where it started.
RIGHT    180
END
.end_keep

.keep
.fi b
BODY and NECK are just straight lines.  After experimenting, you might
decide to try  these sizes:

.nf L
TO    BODY t(m)TO    NECK
FORWARD    15 t(m)FORWARD    5
END t(m)END
.end_keep
.keep

To draw the head, you can use a circle procedure.

TO    HEAD
LEFT    90
RCIRCLE    5
RIGHT    90
END
.end_keep

.fi b
Now, when you type the command, PERSON, you should get this result:
.bp
.section "bold(Project Ideas Using Subprocedures)"
.chapter "bold(Making a Repeating Design)"
It is possible to make complex designs by making the computer repeat a series
of steps over and over again.  There are several ways to carry out a project
of this type.
.section "bold(Making a Repeating Design Using Recursion)"
The procedure FUN makes a simple turtle design:

.nf l
.keep
TO  FUN
FORWARD  30
RIGHT  120
FORWARD  10
LEFT  90
BACK  20
END
.end_keep
.fi b

If you teach the computer to FUN, and repeat FUN several times, another design
begins to appear.  If you make the computer keep repeating these steps
over and over without stopping an
interesting design may result.

.nf l
.keep
TO  FUNNY
FORWARD  30		
RIGHT 120		
FORWARD  10		
LEFT  90
BACK  20
FUNNY
END
.end_keep

.keep
.fi b
FUNNY  is the same as  FUN  except for the last line.  When you type the command FUNNY, the computer will draw a shape, then start
the procedure FUNNY again, draw the same shape, starting from a different place, start
FUNNY again, etc.  It will keep going, eventually retracing the same design
unless you stop the computer by typing 

	<SHIFT> - Z.

This way of making a procedure repeat is called recursion.
.end_keep
.keep

Here are some other examples of recursion:

.nf l
TO SQUARE	
FORWARD  20		
RIGHT  90		
SQUARE		
END		
.sp 4
.end_keep
.keep
TO FLOWER	
RCIRCLE   30

NEWFUN
END
.sp 4
.end_keep
.keep
TO STAR
FORWARD  40
RIGHT  150
STAR
END
.sp 4
.end_keep
.fi b
Try making some recursive procedures of your own. Change the size of the forward step in  SQUARE or the angle in  FLOWER  or  STAR.
.bp
.section "bold(Making Repeating Designs Using the REPEAT Command)"

The LOGO command REPEAT allows you to repeat a command or list
of commands as many times as you want.

.nf l
Examples:

.keep
REPEAT   7   [  FORWARD  10    BACK  10    RIGHT  20 ]
REPEAT   3   [  FUN  ]
REPEAT   4   [  RIGHT  90    FORWARD  20  ]
.end_keep
.fi b

REPEAT needs two inputs.  The first input is a number telling how
many times to repeat something; the second input is a list of instructions.
The list must be enclosed within square brackets  [   ]  ( <SHIFT> - 4  and  <SHIFT> - 5 ). 

REPEAT can also be used in procedures:

Examples:

.nf l
.keep
TO  SQUARE
REPEAT  4    [ RIGHT  90    FORWARD  20 ]
END
.sp 5
.end_keep

.keep
TO FLOWER
REPEAT  6    [ RCIRCLE   30  RIGHT  60 ]
