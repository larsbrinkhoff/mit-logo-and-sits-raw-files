For the past year a group of educators in the Greater Boston Area has been meeting to discuss issues of human values and ethics that arise from the use of computers in education. All of us work with computers and strongly favor their educational use. As the number of schools incorporating computers in educational programs has increased dramatically in the last few years, we have been concerned that certain potential positive and negative effects are not being seriously considered by educators, publishers, and computer manufacturers advocating their use. We have come to focus on a series of issues and questions, some of which arise in any educational context while others are peculiar to computer education. We have grouped our issues into three interrelated categories:

.nf l
1. Pedagogical decisions about how computers are used.
2. The impact of computer use on students.
.fi b
3. Our responsibility to ensure that educational computer use fosters the development of universal computer literacy.

1. Pedagogical Decisions About How Computers Are Used: Are we exercising appropriate care and concern in making educational choices about using computers?

Many schools are acquiring computers without having a clear idea of  their educational potential. Unless we understand the many ways in which computers can be useful in achieving broad educational goals and develop an informed set of priorities for computer use, we run the risk of trivializing the computer's impact.

When we decide to use a computer application we should understand more about it than whether it functions well technically, uses special sound and graphics effects, and appears to meet particular subject matter objectives.Too often computer applications are used without examining ways in which they connect to other approaches to teaching the same subject matter, or their implications for classroom organization.

We should also be aware of the learning theory embedded in a particular computer application.  Many educational computer applications do not make allowances for different learning styles or different emotional reactions to computers by students who use them. Ideally, an educational computer application should offer flexibility for different students, allow for student initiative, and provide appropriate responses to aid student learning.

Finally, in concentrating exclusively on educational software that meets already established educational goals - drill and practice in basic skills, for example - we may be missing opportunities to develop new educational goals that take into account dramatically different learning opportunities. The use of word processing, for example, may allow for new approaches to the teaching of writing that are potentially far more significant than using a computer to  practice spelling.


2. The Impact of Computer Use on Students:  In using computers in education, are we considering the possible social and psychological impacts of computers on individuals, groups of students, and on the school as a whole?


The impact of computers on individuals and schools will strongly depend on pedagogical and managerial decisions that are made about their use. Particular modes of computer use may influence students' psychological development. Computer use may lead to isolation and separatism among students, or to cooperation and appropriate social interaction.  If computers are used primarily in tutorial modes, in which the computers are seen as knowing all answers and directing all educational choices, students may become overly dependent on them for direction and validation. If the primary mode of computer use is programming, some students may develop a sense of power and control that is unrealistic in terms of the "outside world."

Certain individuals are strongly attracted to computers, sometimes to the point of apparent "addiction." Others may reject involvement with computers if they are seen as the province of a computer clique or group of experts. In particular, such polarization may reinforce male/female role stereotypes. In many schools, boys and girls enroll equally in introductory computer courses, but advanced courses are predominantly male. 

Another major issue for schools introducing computers is how to handle those students who become "computer experts." Teachers are often concerned that students will learn too much about computers. In some schools, computer access and knowledge are restricted to prevent the development of such expertise among students. In others, students are trained and given full responsibility for managing complex computer operations. Student computer experts with creative adult support, may become our greatest asset in developing new educational programs and teaching other students and teachers. On the other hand, if student experts become a powerful clique, outside of the mainstream of school life, they can discourage other students from becoming involved with computers and even use computers for destructive purposes. A key factor in determining which of these patterns emerges in a particular school may be the ways in which teachers react to students who gain advanced knowledge about computers.


3. Our Responsibility to Ensure that Educational Computer Use Fosters the Development of Universal Computer Literacy.

We believe that the development of universal computer literacy - defined as that collection of skills, knowledge, understanding, values and relationships necessary to be a productive citizen of a computer based society - is a critical social need of the l980s. Decisions made concerning whether to use computers in education and how to use computers in education can have a significant impact on whether this need is met for many citizens. Teaching students to program and control computers and make choices from a range of computer applications, will contribute to the development of computer literacy. Using computers primarily to deliver instruction may neglect the most significant kinds of learning possible with computers, and, at the same time, reinforce passive acceptance of decisions made or communicated by computers.

We are concerned that computers may widen rather than reduce the gap between more and less affluent groups within our society. Suburban schools are already applying more resources to the purchase and use of computers than schools in less affluent urban and rural communities. Affluent students are more likely to have access to computers in their homes or parents' places of work At the same time, informal observations indicate that when computers are available to students in poorer communities, they are often used for "computer assisted instruction" in hopes of improving students' basic academic skills - relegating computer literacy goals of programming and student computer control to a lower priority. It may be that both the amount of computer access and the type of computer access available to students in their schools will tend to reinforce existing social inequities rather than promote equality of opportunity.
