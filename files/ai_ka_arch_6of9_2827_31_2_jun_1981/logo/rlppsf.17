1Overview0

^^^^^^^^^^For the past decade, M.I.T.'s Logo Project has concerned itself with the interactions of children and computers.   One of my contributions to that effort has been the methodical case study and detailed analysis of one child's cognitive development in our computer rich environment.  That analysis exists as a long and complex doctoral dissertation.  I propose to condense some of this material and refine the conceptualizations to produce two articles -- of professional journal quality -- about the computer's impact on a child's thought.  

^^^^^^^^^^The case study followed the learning of my daughter Miriam from her sixth birthday for six months and more, both in the laboratory and beyond its confines.  Miriam, her brother, and I were constant companions.  All of our work at the Children's Learning Laboratory was recorded on audiotape and some on videotape.  Computer logs and output were saved as well.  Beyond the range of mechanical recording, naturalistic observation traced influences between the computer laboratory and the rest of Miriam's world.  The resulting corpus is a richly textured record of one child's learning -- and one in which it is possible to examine, in detail, the interaction of particular experiences and the child's knowledge.  The motive for constructing so detailed a corpus was the effort to trace the interactions of experience and knowledge as learning occurred.

^^^^^^^^^^To make the analysis of One Child's Learning more accessible, I have chosen to prepare segments of the material and analysis as journal articles.  One such article will soon be published in Cognitive Science.  A second is now ready for submission.  I want to have the time, six months, to produce the two remaining major articles from this study.  Both those remaining articles focus on my daughter's computer-centered learning.

1The Computer's Impact on a Child's Thinking0
.adjust

^^^^^^^^^^From March through August 1981 I will prepare for publication two articles.    The first article is a study of how this six year old was able to learn certain ideas of geometry and the extent to which she succeeded and failed in coming to understand the idea of a variable as it is used in programming.  The second article is about this same child's experience in programming and debugging.  It also touches on the issue of how the skill of debugging affected her life outside the computer environment.  The first aspect of both articles is that they trace one child's learning computer related material.

^^^^^^^^^^Each of the articles has a second aspect which is more important and profound than the article's thematic content.   As we observe this child confront problems of geometry and using variables, we ask why certain ideas function in a powerful way in the mind and what sorts of knowledge is prerequisite in the development of new cognitive structures.  Intertwined with the observation of the "programming" article is the more general issue of how being a member of a culture affects solving problems.  Specifically, the corpus permits a focus on the relative efficacy of verbal knowledge, an artifact which comes about through being a member of a culture , and the knowledge derived from confronting specific problems.  

^^^^^^^^^^Over the two years following our laboratory sessions, I analyzed that material in considerable detail to produce One Child's Learning.  This last year and a half, between other projects, I have taken some time to refine two of the studies from that corpus of material.  Instead of taking another two years to refine material about the computer's impact on a child's thought, I want to set aside the time to do that refinement and integration now.  What I propose then is to take the material from the third chapter of my thesis, to refine the conceptions and better integrate the ideas of the "geometry" and "programming" papers with the two others I have already revised.  During this process of revision, of course, I will also go back to the corpus and put new questions to it - to make sure that my interpretations are sound -- and, where required, to develop better interpretations. Should the effort take fewer than the six months I estimate to be required, I would take the opportunity to produce articles of a more accessible sort,  derived from the more scholarly articles and directed to an audience of educators interested in using computers.

^^^^^^^^^^There are two major reasons for doing this work now.  One reason is timeliness.  The rapid proliferation of personal computers into homes and schools has raised to salience the question of how computer experience will affect children.  The public, educators, and other researchers have begun to recognize a need for the kind of information I can provide.  A second reason is the increasing burden of other research commitments which, by the fall of 1981, will demand nearly all of my time.  I believe I must make this material available now or it will be lost.

^^^^^^^^^^There are other studies of children using computers.  The uniqueness of my study was the theoretical program behind the endeavor.  We used the case study method to construct a corpus of such detail as to provide an empirical foundation for cognitive modelling.  Within a Piagetian framework and using the descriptive tools of Artificial Intelligence, we have striven to achieve the objective Kurt Lewin set as the criterion of a scientific psychology: understanding the mind through the detailed description and explication of the particular case.  As cognitive science, the work is worth the time to make it more accessible to the scholarly community.
