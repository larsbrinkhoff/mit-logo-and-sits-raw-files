TI Logo Version

.fi b
This booklet provides information you will need for using
the keyboard, editing LOGO procedures, saving procedures and shapes on
cassette and recalling them from a cassette.
.bp
.chapter "bold(Using the Keyboard)"
The computer keyboard is like an electric typewriter which allows you to communicate
with the computer.  Like a typewriter it prints each character you type 
but it prints on the TV screen.  
The blinking cursor shows you where the next character will appear.  Some keys have
other special functions.

To send a command to the computer
.br

press the   <ENTER>   key.

To erase one character, or move the cursor back one space
.br

type  <SHIFT> - U
.br

(When using the  <SHIFT>   key, hold it down first, then type the other
key.)

bold(WARNING!!  DO NOT TYPE)  <SHIFT> - Q

.br				
This will restart the computer, erasing all your procedures.

Other special keys are used to edit procedures or create sprite and
tile shapes.  These will be described in the appropriate section.

The LOGO comand,  CS  or  CLEARSCREEN  will  clear
all text from the screen.

.chapter "bold(LOGO Typing Hints)"
Every computer language has its own special rules which can be confusing when you
are learning to use it.  When you type something the computer does not understand
it will complain by sending you an error message.  A few simple practices can help
avoid some typing difficulties.

1.  Always leave a space after a LOGO command or input (except at the
end of a line.)  (The computer needs a space after every word to avoid confusion,
just as we leave a space after a word in English.)

Examples
.br
Type	TELL	0	not	TELL0

Type	SETCOLOR    :RED	not	 SETCOLOR:RED

2.  When using an input name such as   :RED,  think of the : as the first "letter"
of the name.  The color or "dots" tells the computer to find the number associated
with the name.  (Never leave a space after the   :   .)

Type	SETCOLOR    :RED	not	SETCOLOR:   RED
				or	SETCOLOR   :   RED

.keep
3.  Don't use  :  when typing numbers.

Type 	SETCOLOR   6	 not	 SETCOLOR   :6
.end_keep

4.  Explore what happens when you make a typing mistake by
trying to type some buggy commands. Each of these commands will result in an error message:


.nf l
.keep
Examples:
TELL0   <ENTER>

SETC:   RED    <ENTER>

CARRY   :   PLANE    <ENTER>

SETS   :10    <ENTER>

.end_keep

.chapter "bold(Using the LOGO Editor)"
The LOGO procedure editor makes it easy to change or define a procedure.
In addition to normal typing, you can use special editing keys to:

- add something to a line
.br
- rub out and change part of a line
.br
- erase an entire line
.br
- add a new line


To change an existing procedure type ED, or EDIT followed by the procedure
name.  To start writing a new procedure using the editor, just type ED or
EDIT, without a procedure name.  To stop using the editor, and return to
the LOGO interpreter, type  <SHIFT> - G.	

.fi b
Once you type EDIT, you will be communicating directly with the editor.
You can either type in text, or change text that is already there.
The red object in the upper lefthand corner of the screen is
called the edit cursor.  By moving the edit cursor and
using editing commands, you can make changes in what has been typed.

bold(Commands to Move the Cursor)
 
You can move the edit cursor using the  <SHIFT>  key, and the arrow keys.

.nf L

	<SHIFT> -			s(m)moves cursor up one line

	<SHIFT> -			t(m)moves cursor down one line

	<SHIFT> -			t(m)moves cursor left one space

	<SHIFT> -			t(m)moves the cursor right one space

	<SHIFT> - A			t(m)moves the cursor back to the beginning 
				t(m)of a line

	<SHIFT> - F			t(m)moves the cursor to the end of a line.

	<SHIFT> - V			t(m)moves down to the next screen of 
				t(m)text, when there is more text than will
				t(m)fit on the screen.

	<SHIFT> - W			t(m)moves up to the previous screen of
				t(m)text when there is more text than will fit
				t(m)on one screen.

	<ENTER>                     t(m)creates a new line and moves the cursor 
                                        t(m)down to the beginning of the new line.
				t(m)If there is any text to the right
				t(m)of the cursor it will be moved too.

  <SHIFT> - R     <ENTER>			t(m)this combination can be used to create a
				t(m)blank line.

.keep
bold(Editing Commands)

	<SHIFT> - T			t(m)erases the character above the cursor.

	<SHIFT> - U			t(m)rubs out the character behind the cursor,
				t(m)just as it does when you are typing
				t(m)normal LOGO commands.

	<SHIFT> - C			t(m)erases everything on a line to the right
			     t(m)of the cursor.
	
	<SHIFT> - G			t(m)This tells the interpreter that you are 
				t(m)finished editing and ready to return
           			t(m)to using normal Logo commands.
.end_keep


bold(Learning to Use the Logo Editor)

.fi b
The best way to learn to use the Logo editor is to try editing a procedure.
If you already have a procedure, you can edit it by typing:

EDIT	(name of your procedure)	<ENTER>

Then experiment with the different editing commands to see what to do.
When you are finished editing type
.nf L

<SHIFT> - G

.fi b

To show you a little about how to use the editor, here is a simple example
that you can follow by reading along.  If you prefer, you you can type
each command and follow along using your computer.

First, you'll need a simple procedure to practice on.  Type in a
procedure like this:

.nf l
.keep
TO   HI    <ENTER>
PRINT   [HELLO  FRIEND]  <ENTER>
END   <ENTER>
.end_keep

.keep
To try out the procedure, just type

HI  <ENTER>

.end_keep

Now you can use the editor to change the procedure.  Type:

EDIT   HI   <ENTER>

.fi b
and the entire procedure will appear on the editing screen, with the edit
cursor under the T in the upper left-hand corner.

.nf l
.keep
TO   HI
PRINT  [HELLO   FRIEND]
END
.end_keep

.fi b
.keep
Here's how you could add the word "MY" between "HELLO" and "FRIEND".

1.  Move the edit cursor down one space using 

.nf l
<SHIFT> -     		t(m)TO   HI
				t(m)PRINT   [HELLO   FRIEND]
				t(m)END
.end_keep
.keep
2.  Move the cursor over several spaces using

<SHIFT> -			t(m)TO   HI
				t(m)PRINT   [HELLO__FRIEND]
				t(m)END
.end_keep
.keep

3.  Type in the new word.

<SPACE>  MY			t(m)TO   HI
				t(m)PRINT   [HELLO   MY__FRIEND]
				t(m)END
.end_keep

.fi b
4.  If this was all you wanted to do, you could just type <SHIFT> - G   to
return to the Interpreter.

Suppose you wanted to add another line before doing that.  To add a new
line, you have to first move the cursor out to the end of the line it is
already on, by typing

.keep
.nf l
<SHIFT> - F			t(m)TO   HI
				t(m)PRINT   [HELLO   MY   FRIEND] __
				t(m)END
.end_keep

.keep
To move the cursor down and open up a new line, type

<ENTER>				t(m)TO   HI
				t(m)PRINT   [HELLO   MY   FRIEND]
				t(m)__
				t(m)END
.end_keep

.keep
Now, type in a new line.  For example,

TO   HI
PRINT   [HELLO   MY   FRIEND]
PRINT   [HOW ARE YOU TODAY?]__
EMD
.end_keep

.fi b
The procedure has now been changed, and if you are satisfied, type

<SHIFT> - G

This will return you to the LOGO interpreter which will be ready to
accept regular LOGO commands.

Try out the new command by typing

HI    <ENTER>

.keep
Further Information About the Editor
.br
0It is possible to start writing a procedure with the editor, by typing
EDIT.  The computer will then display a blank screen, on which you can
define a procedure in the usual way by typing  TO   FOO, etc.
.end_keep

You can define more than one procedure at a time, using the editor.  After
typing END, go on to define another procedure in the usual way.
.fi b

.chapter "bold(Saving and Recalling Information)"
.section "bold(Saving Your Procedures and Shapes on Cassette)"
Once you have taught the computer some new procedures or created some
new
shapes you may want to save them, so that you can use the procedures
and shapes at a later date.

First, make sure the cassette recorder is properly connected to the
computer, as
shown in the figure:
.bp
Second, Make sure the tone and volume controls of the cassette
recorder are set properly.  Set the tone to 9 and set the volume to 7.
These settings work for a panasonic RQ-2309A cassette recorder.  If you
have a different kind of recorder you will have to experiment to find the
proper setting.

Third, insert a tape in the recorder.  If you use an old tape, be sure
that it does not contain procedures that you want to keep.  When you
save
your current procedures, any other information stored on the tape will
be lost.

To save procedures type   SAVE   <ENTER>

To save sprite shapes or title shapes type   SS   <ENTER>

Once you type SAVE or SS, the computer will give you some instructions:

REWIND CASSETTE TAPE CS1.

THEN PRESS ENTER.

PRESS CASSETTE RECORD CS1.

THEN PRESS ENTER.

.fi b
After the tape has been running for a few minutes, the computer will print,

.nf L
PRESS CASSETTE STOP  CS1

THEN PRESS ENTER.

.fi b
It will then ask you if you want to check the information.  It's a good
idea to type Y (for yes), so that you can make sure the process worked.
After you type Y, folow the printed directions again.

.section "bold(Loading Information From Cassettes)"
After inserting a cassette in the recorder type LOAD (to load procedures) or
LS (to load shapes).  Follow the directions printed by the computer.
