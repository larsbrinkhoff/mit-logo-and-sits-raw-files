^^^^^^^^^^Taking behavior seriously is one of the strongest traditions of American Psychology.  Behavior observation provides such noisy data one must select specific phenomena and forms of explanation for interpretation.  I follow  Papert's (1980) attempt to explain learning as the creation of entities, new agents within a society of mind, for resolving conflicts between subordinates.  Papert's idea is sufficiently general that it may seem abstract though it is not so.  Like Winston's (1975) structural descriptions (a specific representation of concrete schemata), Papert's proposal will be subject to criticism with the rhetorical question, "How can this idea possibly apply to so complex a thing as the human mind^?"  My work -- the detailed interpretation of case study material with AI derived descriptions -- addresses that question.

^^^^^^^^^^Precisely how a particular mind solves a specific problem may be very difficult to understand.  Why so^?  A common central element of the visions of Freud and Piaget is that early experiences are critical in shaping the person a child becomes.  This implies the structures solving problems have a significant historical dimension.  The case study is the method of choice when confronting complex situations involving people, whether in the psychology of personality (see White, 1952), or in the study of creative thinking (see Gruber, 1974).  Case studies often exhibit intermittent coverage of life dominating issues and involve consideration of the individual over a protracted period of time.  In everyday problem solving, by contrast, the long case study of a single subject has not had so much importance as in these other areas.  (A note here: Piaget's classic infant study involves interleaved observations on three different individuals.)

^^^^^^^^^^In a discussion of the stability of Piagetian states, Flavell (1963) asked:

.margin 1i 1i 1.5i 1.5i
"...how do conservation and other Piagetian concepts develop^?... how are they in fact acquired normally -- that is in the child's day to day bouts with the real world^?... It is not likely that the ...question can ever receive a direct and precise answer... [but] posing of the question in this way suggests a research endeavor which has not yet been exploited: an ecological study of the young child's mundane interchanges with his workaday world...along the lines of Barker and  Wright's work...."

Barker and Wright (1971) take behavior very seriously, for example:

"^^^^^On June 2, 1949, four-year-old Margaret Reid spent 28 minutes in the Midwest behavior setting, Home Meal (lunchtime)....her behavior was consistent with the standing behavior pattern of the lunchtime setting.  But this is by no means all.  Margaret did 42 clearly discriminable and different things on the level of behavior episodes during the 28 minutes.  Here...are 21 of the 42 actions, just half the total:

Rejecting lemonade; Recollecting pancakes eaten for breakfast; Cutting tomato; Helping self to noodles; Forecasting Bible School picnic; Challenging little brother to lunch eating race; Appraising combination of lemon juice and milk; Inquiring about Valentine's day; Coping with dropped napkin; Commenting on play of neighbor friend; Playing on words about Bible School picnic; Wiping something out of eye; Reporting  little brother's capers; Dunking cookies in cocktail sauce; Telling about imaginary friends; Putting box of Kleenex on bench; Inviting parents to look into stomach; Soliciting mother's opinion on brother's eating; Using spoon as airplane; Chanting "Bones to Be, Bones to Be"; Reporting on birthday greetings at Bible School...."

Barker and Wright then expand one of these incidents -- Cutting tomato -- into fifteen, more detailed action-descriptions.  How can anyone make sense of such observations^?  Doing so  requires significant selection.

^^^^^^^^^^The difficulty with Flavell's proposal is  significant learning takes so long that such detailed observation can not be endured, not by observers, not by subjects, nor by a theorist.  With such detail, there could be no study long  enough for a good sample of significant learning to be captured.  Partly in reaction, partly in response to the example of Goodall (1971), I undertook something different, which I call an Intimate Study, one of my daughter's learning "in^the^wild", that is, in my family and laboratory.  This included 67 sessions in the Logo computer laboratory and 24 at home.  Transcriptions of these sessions comprise the basic corpus; it is extended by a hundred thirty "vignettes" -- documents of naturalistic observation focussed on learning outside the laboratory.  The length of the study was six months and more, beginning at her age six.

^^^^^^^^^^A study within the nuclear family offers unique opportunities, but it is not without its disadvantages and risks.  The value of a parent's knowledge can be enormous in making sense of what a child says and does. The possible complications are significant also: disruption of the household routine; increased jealously between the children; increased tension between all family members; distortion of the normal parent-child relation in ways that may give a child uncommon power or the later feeling of having been used.  The careful consideration of such possible strains produces a novelty, forces a new relationship between the experimenter and subject.

^^^^^^^^^^Because their relation as people is prior to and more important than any research objective, that relationship comes first and brings with it another.  The subject and experimenter work as colleagues where each makes an appropriate contribution to the effort.  The two are both in the center of the study; and the focus of the study shifts to how the subject copes with problems within the influential sphere of the experimenter.  This raises serious questions about the extent to which such a study can be objective.  (But see Langers's arguments, 1967, favoring such studies.)  Two techniques to constrain subjectivity are heavy dependence on mechanical recording and noting the perspective from which a naturalistic observation is judged as significant.  The same person -- as interpreter -- may later judge the observation's significance differently.

^^^^^^^^^^Does such an intimate study prove valuable in practice^?  I believe our study permits a more concrete exemplification of processes of mental development than has been possible before.  The corpus has proven detailed enough to trace learning -- seen as structural change -- and the interaction of cognitive structures with specific elements of the setting. (See Lawler, 1979, 1981a, 1981b.)  Finally, the study illuminates in concrete examples how the particularity of knowledge relates to the achievement of generally applicable skills.

^^^^^^^^^^The value of any empirical corpus depends on how one forms an interpretation of the material.  My interpretation uses the following representations and processes of learning.  Minsky's comment (1976) that AI needed a more precise theory of the emergence of control structure in the mind set the specific objective.   MICROWORLDS -- my representation of basic cognitive structures -- are descendents of Winston-like structural descriptions.  The primary learning process invoked is Papert's (1980) "entity creation", through which an originally competitive organization of microworlds becomes hierarchical at need.     My work extends this idea, which I call the elevation of control, to the interpetation of numerous natural examples.  The generation of these entites is proposed in a style that is cognate with Winston's "near miss".  I explain the intergration of separate and distinct microworlds by the conversion of suppressive "must-not-confound" links between them into simple, specific relations, such as serial invocation.  Implicit in microworlds is the application of existing structure to a new task when the new problem is not recognized as significantly different from others previously encountered (as in Sussman's model, l975).  The conjunction of the ideas of Minsky, Papert, Sussman and Winston is not a mere agglomeration but an extension and integration through concrete application -- based on taking behavior seriously.
