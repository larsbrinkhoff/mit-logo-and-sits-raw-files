bold(DESIGN CRITERIA FOR COLLABORATIVE CLASSROOM RESEARCH)

by Daniel H. Watt and Molly Watt

	0We believe that a school can best be viewed as a community in which
teachers, students, and administrators work together to create an
atmosphere conducive to learning.  Within such a community, an ongoing
process of growth and development takes place.  The
learning environment created results from the balancing of
many needs, interests, ideas, values and constraints, and is
continually shifting to reflect new balances among those forces.
When an outside researcher enters such a community to introduce and
assess changes in school practice, to test a particular psychological
theory, or to observe the behaviors of students and teachers in
certain settings, all parties should be sensitive to issues and
problems that might arise from his or her presence:

	The presence of outside observers in a classroom may arouse the
curiosity of the students, as well as raise questions for a teacher about whether 
the observer approves or disapproves of classroom practices.	

	The researchers' methods, agendas and time-lines may not have been
coordinated with the teacher in whose classroom the research is to
take place, thus interfering with long term plans.

	Changes in classroom practice suggested by a researcher, although
small in terms of total impact, require replanning
by the teacher, and may require that teacher and students adjust to a new routine.

	A researcher interested in controlling or observing one particular
aspect of classroom practice, may not be aware of the subtle ways in
which many different aspects of a classroom community are
interrelated.  Altering one aspect of a classroom may have impact in
other areas.

	Teachers may not have had the training necessary to understand
research methods.  Thus the research itself may be surrounded by a
special mystique which interferes with cooperation between teacher and
researcher.


	We believe that the relationship between a researcher and a classroom community should be given
the same thoughtful attention and careful planning that is usually given to the content
and design of a research project. Our experience leads us to the view that the best way to ensure such a relationship is to offer teachers the opportunity for full collaboration in all aspects of a research project. In the next section we suggest a set of criteria for research design intended to foster such collaboration.

bold(THE DESIGN CRITERIA)


	Our suggested criteria are based on our own experiences, which include both education research and classroom teaching. From a teacher's point of view, we want the research to benefit the classroom community. From a researcher's viewpoint, we want results that can influence the development of improved classroom practice. We believe that both objectives will be served by collaborative research conducted according to the four criteria we suggest:  (1.) Classroom research should offer direct benefits to all its participants - teachers and students, as well as researchers.  Long range goals, including the national
significance of the findings, although of critical importance to
researchers, funding agencies, and ultimately to the schools, 
do not in themselves justify disruption of the school community.  (2.)  As much as possible, teachers, students and school administrators
should collaborate with researchers in the planning and implementing
of school based research projects.  (3.)  Research should be conducted with honesty, openness and mutual
respect.  Research designs should not require misleading or
misinforming students or teachers.  (4.)  Observations and data collection should be as unobtrusive and
natural as possible, and the participants should be informed of the
purposes and methods of those observations.  Aspects of data
collection that disrupt class routines without being beneficial to
students (such as some types of pre- and post- testing) should be minimized.

	In elaborating these points, we will draw informally on our own
teaching and research experiences, on personal knowledge of other
projects, and on published reports of classroom research.

	(1.)  The first consideration in any proposed classroom research should
be:  will the benefits of the process to teachers and students outweigh
the disruption caused by the project?  While the researchers benefit
directly through employment on a research project, enhanced academic
or professional standing, and the intellectual challenge of the
research, other direct benefits should result for members of the school
community.  Although we should consider the long term benefits that
might result from the findings of the research, those findings
rarely benefit the participants directly.

	Many research reports indicate to us that some researchers see
students as convenient "guinea pigs," to be used in testing their own
hypotheses.  A number of research designs involve the use of control
groups--students who do not directly benefit from a project activity,
but who nonetheless are required to participate in interviews, respond
to questionnaires or take tests that may themselves be disruptive and
time consuming.  Other research designs involve manipulating the
classroom environment in ways that may disturb the learning environment without enhancing it.  One recent report described how groups of
second and seventh grade students were subjected to repeated shifts in
seating arrangements to see whether there was any change in "study
behavior" (Axelrod, Hall and Tams, 1979). In another study, 72
sixth graders were subjected to a set of questionnaires designed to measure their
anxiety levels.  One third of the students were then given test
instructions designed to increase anxiety, while others were given
neutral or supposedly positive instructions (Trentham, 1979).  Such
activities could easily disrupt the sense of trust that must exist between teachers and students in a successful classroom community.

	Once the principle is established that students and teachers are
not merely convenient research subjects,
there may be many ways that a research project can offer
benefits to school communities in which the research takes place.
Students may benefit through
participating in new learning experiences that are part of the
research activity, or through increased awareness and sensitivity on
the part of their teachers.  Training provided by a research project
can be an important professional growth opportunity for many teachers.
A teacher who has learned new skills of teaching or observing will be
better able to provision a classroom for student learning.  In addition, the researcher can offer more tangible compensations by, for example, donating a book to the classroom library of any class used for research, by presenting a slide show about the research to a school assembly, by offering materials and equipment used for research as a supplement to those already available in the classroom, or even by giving students a party or tickets
to a play in appreciation of their participation in the research.

	(2.)  Teachers, students and school administrators should collaborate as
much as possible in the design, planning and implementation of
classroom research.  A research project, no matter how
beneficial to the students and teachers involved, cannot help but
cause some disturbance or disruption to the educational objectives and
daily routines of the classroom.  Careful negotiations are often
required to ensure that benefits are equitably distributed, or that the project does not
unduly disrupt the larger community. Involvement of
teachers in planning the research is one way to minimize such disruption.  Unfortunately
teacher participation cannot be assumed.
Planning research is not part of a teacher's job description, and
teachers may find the time required for careful planning to be an
unacceptable extra burden.

	Research projects should be set up to allow teachers a degree of
choice as to their involvement in the project--ranging from full
collaboration in the project to a more passive, yet fully informed participation in the research.  Project time lines should allow for teacher
feedback during all stages -- planning, implementation,
and data analysis.  We question the acceptability of research designs,
no matter how beneficial, that do not allow the classroom teacher to
choose whether or not to participate, or do not provide for some
degree of collaboration for a teacher who desires to participate.


	(3.)  Research should be conducted with honesty, openness and mutual
respect.  Reports of research designed to mislead teachers and
students has led to educators' distrust of researchers.  Examples of this type of research are
regularly reported in education-related journals and magazines.  We
appreciate that there is a distinction between research in which deliberate
falsehood is an essential part of the research design, and research
designs in which student or teacher behavior is to be manipulated in
ways that preclude an honest description of what the research is about
or how the activities are to be conducted. However, we believe that those who conduct either type of research are not straightforward about their intentions and are therefore harmful to the classrooms in which the research takes place,  and to the education research community in general.

	Perhaps the most famous example of the use of deliberate falsehood in
education research is the study known as "Pygmalion in the Classroom,"
designed to determine the effect of teacher expectations on student
achievement (Rosenthal and Jacobsen, l968).  By giving teachers false
information which indicated that certain students were "late bloomers," about to
achieve greater academic success, the researchers attempted to observe the relationship between teacher expectation and student success.  The results of student achievement
tests led the researchers to claim that when teachers expected a
student to do better, the student's achievement increased.  This finding corresponded with the previously held views of many educators and psychologists that teachers' attitudes can help or hinder student achievement.

	An inadvertant consequence, not considered by the researchers, was the effect that publication of their deceptive research methodology had on teachers' attitudes towards educational researchers. Remembering examples of deception of teachers by researchers, many teachers now
distrust researchers who want to investigate any aspect of the
teaching and learning process. We believe that it is appropriate for a teacher to wonder about a researcher's hidden agenda, and whether there is misleading
information, or secret manipulation involved in the research.

	More fundamentally, we believe that the results of research based on
falsehood are themselves suspect.  Researchers who deliberately
mislead their subjects cannot be expected to report honestly on the
outcomes of their experiments.  We have often wondered whether the
researchers involved in the "Pygmalion in the Classroom" project might
have had another hidden research agenda.  Perhaps they were studying
the effect of releasing misleading information about education
research on public opinion and on the education community.  Unless
honesty and ethical behavior are an integral part of the research
process from start to finish, there is no reason to trust the validity
of the research findings or the truthfulness of the researchers.

	While the deliberate use of falsehood is regularly reported as a
technique of psychological research conducted among college students
and adults, such techniques are rarely used
with younger students.  On the other hand, research in which student
behavior is manipulated without explanation is quite common.  We believe that such research
can have harmful consequences for the classrooms in which it takes
place.  Students have a right to expect that teachers will deal with
them in a straightforward manner in giving reasons for classroom practices,
especially when changes are taking place.  In our experience, students
know when they are being manipulated by adults, or when information is being
deliberately withheld from them.  Even when students are unwilling or unable to articulate
this, such knowledge can have damaging consequences for the sense of
community in a classroom, thereby  distorting the results of the research.

	As an example, consider a research project (Miller, Brickman, Bolen,
1975) which was a controlled experiment designed to test the effects
of two different approaches to modifying student behavior:
"persuasion" and "attribution."  ("We've got to keep our classroom
cleaner!" vs. "We are a litter conscious class!"). What were students told about
the experiment?  Did the teachers suddenly develop a new set of
behaviors for six weeks, without discussing the situation with the
students?  Did the students cooperate out of loyalty for their teachers, or because they were convinced by what their teachers said?  Were the students involved ever informed that they
had participated in an experiment, or given an opportunity to discuss
the results?  Did researchers investigate the consequences of the
experiment itself for the overall quality of the classroom community?  We question
whether teachers can participate in such a study and still maintain a
position of trust with their classes. 

	(4.)  Observations and data collection should be as unobtrusive and natural
as possible, while ensuring that participants are aware of the purposes
and methods of observation.  Students are naturally curious about any
changes in their classrooms, from a new book or piece of furniture, to
the presence of a new person.  While observers should be careful to
minimize their impact on the situations being observed, students
should know them as people, who have names, voices, and ideas.  In
our experience, a simple introduction and explanation leads to less disruption than an anonymous
observer, attempting to remain unnoticed.

	Several years ago an observer made regular appearances in Dan Watt's
fifth grade classroom for the purpose of observing students who were
participants in a special tutoring program.  The
students  were not informed about who or what was being observed in the
classroom or why the observer was present.  The observer tried to stay
in the background, taking copious notes, and regularly consulting her
stopwatch.  Despite the care taken by the observer to remain
unnoticed, the teacher realized that the students being
watched were acutely aware of
the observer's presence.  One such student resorted to spending his
time staring at the observer, paying careful attention to what she
was doing.  Obviously the attempt to capture the child's "natural
classroom behavior" had been seriously undermined, along with the
normal classroom routine.  If the observer had introduced herself
to the students, explained what she was doing with her notebook and stopwatch, and taken an interest in their work and classroom, she could gradually have become an
accepted part of the class routine, and both she and the students would have been able to
work more effectively.

bold(EXAMPLES OF CLASSROOM RESEARCH AS A COLLABORATION)
bold(BETWEEN TEACHERS AND RESEARCHERS)


	The involvement of teachers as collaborative partners or initiators of
research projects is an encouraging trend in education research. We have been personally involved in several such collaborations and in
this section we describe three of them.
They include a teacher initiated research
project, a project in which large numbers of teachers were involved
in the collection and interpretation of data for a long term study,
and a federally-funded, university-initiated project in which an
innovative computer-based learning environment was implemented and
assessed in a school setting.

	As part of a graduate program under the direction of George Hein at Lesley College, Molly Watt initiated and conducted an investigation of
how five-, six- and seven-year-olds understand the loss of loved ones
through death, divorce, moving and school year endings.  The research
focus was chosen because of her insight that some inappropriate behavior
was an indication of incomplete mourning on the part of her students.
As an experienced teacher, she wanted to learn how the children's
completion of the mourning process could be supported in the classroom
in order to allow them to move on in their own learning.

	Molly presented the study to her young students openly and simply.  "I
am studying how some of you feel when your pet dies or a friend moves so
that I can learn to be a better teacher to you by knowing how to help you feel
better."  She took notes on children's conversations, taped class
meeting discussions and saved children's writings and drawings related
to this topic.  The methods of documentation were easily integrated
with her role of classroom teacher.  She documented the children's
responses to the losses that occurred in the natural unfolding of the
school year:  a bird flew into the window and died, the student
teacher's internship was finished, a child moved out of district, the
iguana died, the bunny died, the school year ended.  When children
demonstrated curiosity about her work, she shared the information they
needed. When children asked, they were allowed to listen to the tapes or
look at the collection of writings and drawings.

	Immediate benefits for the students included the increased sensitivity
and attention to the process of dealing with endings and loss.
Molly made reading books for the class library based on the children's own
words describing their own experiences with moving, separation and loss. As students read the books which they themselves had illustrated, their understandings about grief were reinforced as the regular reading program was supplemented.  Unanticipated benefits
were the ripple of good feeling and mutual trust which grew from the
process.  It was important for the children to see their teacher as a
learner and to begin to understand that learning is part of a life-long process.

	Long term benefits included a workshop on "Saying Goodbye" given for
teachers at the Brookline Teacher Center.  Some of
the data were included in a paper describing a seminar for teachers
engaged in research into children's thinking (M. Watt, 1979). (See
Chapter 9  for more information on the Children's Thinking Seminars.)  An article
in Learning magazine described ways to build preparation for the
end of the year into classroom activities throughout the year (M. Watt, 1980).  In these ways some practical aspects of the research were
shared with other teachers.  A children's book designed to help children and
teachers prepare for the end of the school year is now in manuscript
form.

	Our second example comes from a study of democratic classrooms initiated by Dr.
Ralph Mosher of Boston University, and
funded by the Danforth Foundation.  Public school
teachers from Brookline, Massachusetts were enlisted as participants in designing a
research project to document  practices designed to foster democracy in their classrooms, and the
relationship of those practices to the process of educating children
for responsible citizenship in a democratic society. The
teachers were paid by the grant for after-school time spent as
researchers, and further supported by access to videotape and
photographic  documentation.  Participants attended
bi-weekly seminars to learn from developmental psychologists and from each other.

	The knowledge and experience shared by the psychologists in their presentations and through informal consultations helped the participants develop clearer prespectives about their own research. Some of the teachers prepared
presentations of the research they had conducted in their classrooms for workshops and
conferences (Lickona, Mosher, and Paradise, 1979). One major outcome of the three-year project will be a book with
chapters authored by individual teacher/researchers (Lickona, Mosher
and Paradise, 1981).  Significant immediate benefit to the students and
teachers resulted from their greater understanding of and sophistication about
democratic practices in their own classrooms.

	The university-initiated project described in our third example was also designed so that students and teachers enjoyed many direct benefits. Under the leadership of Professor Seymour Papert, the MIT Logo Group
has spent a number of years developing a computer language for
children and a computer based learning environment in which children
can learn computer programming, problem solving and mathematics.
During 1976-77, Dan Watt, then a fifth grade teacher,
spent a year on sabattical leave with the Logo Group at MIT.  The
following year, the National Science Foundation provided funds for a
year-long study of the Logo learning environment
at the Lincoln School in Brookline, Massachusetts (Papert and Watt,
1978).  Dan Watt had a full time role, supported by the grant, to act
as a teacher/researcher and to coordinate interactions among the MIT
research team and the students, teachers and school administrators
involved.  As an experienced teacher who had already spent a year with
the researchers, he was able to be sensitive to the needs and expectations
of all project participants.

	During the course of the project, several days of release time were
provided to the classroom teachers involved, to encourage their
collaboration.  During the release days, and in many other less formal
meetings, the teachers were informed about the progress of the
project, received training in computer education, and were able to
offer feedback and suggestions about the content and process of the
project to the researchers.

	Immediate benefit to the students and teachers was a major concern to
all participants throughout the project.  Project funding was designed
to provide for a detailed observational study of the learning
experiences of sixteen representative sixth grade students (Papert et
al., 1979;D. Watt, 1979).  The staff of the school wanted the project
to be a more integral part of the school, and insisted that all sixth
grade students be offered the same opportunity to participate.  This
could have placed a severe strain on the tight project budget, but the project staff
resolved the issue creatively by finding university students to act as volunteer
teachers for all the sixth graders.

	The project benefited its participants in another way.  Because the
research involved many hours of detailed observations of student
learning, the researchers were able to share insights about students'
learning styles, strengths and weaknesses with their classroom
teachers.  By meeting regularly with the researchers, the teachers
were able to take advantage of the researchers' insights to plan for
the students' regular classroom work.  As a result of this
collaboration, it was possible for classroom teachers and specialists
to plan new intervention strategies for certain students with severe
learning problems.  

	Subsequently, the school system decided to create
its own pilot Logo project, in which computers were placed directly in
classrooms.  As the school carried out this project, the
MIT Logo group was able to provide support for some additional teacher
training and curriculum materials to support classroom use of the
computers.  The use of the Logo computers is now a regular part of the
program at Lincoln School, involving eight classroom teachers and all
students in grades 4-8.

	Another outcome of the project was a plan to utilize the methods of
the Logo project with learning disabled students.  Noting the success of
learning disabled students reported in the original research study
(Papert et al., 1979), Dr. Robert Sperber, Brookline's Superintendent
of Schools, initiated planning for a new project aimed directly at these
students.  A committee consisting of university
researchers, special education teachers, and school administrators was
formed to plan the project.  The joint planning involved ensures
that the impact of this project, when it occurs, will be significantly
greater than if it had been developed primarily by university
researchers. (D. Watt, and Weir, 1980).

bold(CONCLUSIONS)


	0In considering the impact of educational research on a school
community, we have focused primarily on the potential for
collaboration between teachers and researchers.   We also feel that there are appropriate roles for students,
parents and school administrators, as collaborators in classroom
research.  Without a consideration of their roles and rights, no analysis of the
impact of research on the classroom community could be considered
complete.  

	Finally, we want to reiterate our belief that there is
important work to be accomplished in the field of educational
research.  If the findings are to endure in
a significant way, teachers must participate as willing collaborators
in the process, adding their own understanding of a classroom
community and its needs to the research design.  The process itself
must be beneficial to the educational community, regardless
of any eventual findings.  We believe that reliable findings require
presenting the project openly and honestly to the school community.
We believe that if these criteria were consistently met by
researchers, the schism and mutual suspicion that often exists between
classroom practitioners and educational researchers could be
significantly reduced.   We believe that educators and researchers
have much to learn from each other.  The process of collaboration
could lead to more significant research questions and the
development of less disruptive research methods.  Collaborative research
is more likely to lead to new understandings of the complex and
delicate issues surrounding the creation of environments to support human
growth and development.
