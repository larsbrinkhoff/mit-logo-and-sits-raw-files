I - Presently availible material

.ad
Here is a brief list of suggested readings. Most of this material can be found in public libraries, book stores, computer stores, or special computer education resource centers such as Project LOCAL in Westwood, the Lesley College Computer Center, or the TERC (Technical Education Research Center) in Cambridge.

l. Nevison, John, "The Computer as Pupil: The Dartmouth Secondary School Project", Dartmouth College, l970.
This report describes work done in secondary schools in the late 1960s. Although the situations described were extremely primitive - only one terminal for an entire high school, the project and the report had an excellent approach, and outstanding values as regards computer use by students. It is still well worth reading. Of particular interest are its comments about teacher training and teaching conditions. 

2. Kemeny, John,"Man and The Computer", Signet, l972.
This book gives a readable introduction to the idea of a computer as a personal tool, and of computer access as a personal right, like access to a public library. Kemeny pioneered both Timesharing and the BASIC language at Dartmouth during the sixties. Although Kemeny's book is dated in many ways, it still carries a powerful and relevant vision of an exciting relationship between people and computers. Timesharing is no longer the best way to meet many of Kemeny's objectives, and there are now computer languages which are  more suitable for beginners than BASIC. This should be kept in mind in reading the book.

3. Papert, Seymour, "Twenty Things To Do With a Computer" 
    "        "    , "Teaching Children to Be Mathematicians, Vs. Teaching Them About Mathematics" 
   Watt, Daniel, "A Comparison of the Problem Solving Styles of Two Children Learning LOGO" (Creative Computing, December, 1979)

These three papers give an overview of the philosophy of the MIT LOGO Group, and a brief description of the work of two students at Lincoln School. (A full report on the federally supported LOGO project at Lincoln School during 1977-78, is given in the two volume "Final Report of The Brookline LOGO Project,"  which is highly recommended if you've got time). These give a concrete vision of new learning possibilities using computers.

4. Kay, Alan, "Microelectronics and the Personal Computer", Scientific American, September, l977.
This is a look at a more advanced computer environment that has been developed for educational purposes. The kinds of activities Kay describes are  availible on more advanced computer systems than schools can currently afford. This situation is changing rapidly as computer hardware costs decrease. 

5. Weizenbaum, Joseph, "Computer Power and Human Reason", Freeman, l975.
This book is a subtle and profound look at some deep problems and issues relating to the widespread proliferation of computers. Weizenbaum explores both broad societal effects, as well as effects on individual computer users. The book is controversial and somewhat one-sided, but it is the most serious attempt to deal with issues that are largely ignored by the general public.  

.ce II - Forthcoming Books
.ad
Two books to be published next  year are extremely appropriate.

1. Papert, Seymour, "Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas", Basic Books.
A full exposition of the LOGO approach to computer use, and its ramifications for education in the future.

2. Taylor, Robert, "The Computer in Education: Tutor, Tool, Tutee," Basic Books.
This book is a collection of articles by five leaders in the area of computer uses in education: Patrick Suppes, Alfred Bork, Arthur Luehrmann, Thomas Dwyer and Seymour Papert. 

.ce III - Special Interest: Hardware
