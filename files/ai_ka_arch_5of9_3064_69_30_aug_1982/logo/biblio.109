Logo Memo 1:  A Computer Laboratory for Elementary Schools, Seymour Papert, October, 
.in +15
1971 ($1.25) (AIM 246) 
.sp 1
This is a research project on elementary education whose
immediate objective is the development of new methods and materials
for teaching in an environment of computers and computer controlled
devices.  Longer term objectives are related to theories of cognitive
processes and to conjectures about the possibility of producing much
larger changes than are usually thought possible in the expected
intellectual achievement of children.  This proposal is formulated in
terms of the self- sufficient immediate objectives.

Logo Memo 2:  Teaching Children Thinking, Seymour Papert, October, 1971,($1.25) (AIM 247)
.in +15
.sp 
The phrase technology and education usually means inventing new
gadgets to teach the same old stuff in a thinly disguised version of
the same old way.  Moreover, if the gadgets are computers, the same
old teaching becomes incredibly more expensive and biased towards its
dullest parts, namely the kind of rote learning in which measurable
results can be obtained by treating the children like pigeons in a
Skinner box.
.sp
The purpose of this essay is to present a grander vision of an
educational system in which technology is used not in the form of
machines for processing children but as something the child himself
will learn to manipulate, to extend, to apply to projects, thereby
gaining a greater and more articulate mastery of the world, a sense
of the power of applied knowledge and a self-confidently realistic 
image of himself as an intellectual agent.  Stated more simply,
I believe with Dewey, Montessori and Piaget that children learn by
doing and by thinking about what they do.  And so the fundamental
ingredients of educational innovation must be better things to do and
better ways to think about oneself doing these things.

Each section of this paper describes something one can do with
a computer.  As you read on you will be learning a computer language
called Logo.  In order to use a computer language you do not need 
to know how the computer works -- no more than you need to know how
a human brain works in order to give a person instructions.  In both
cases you need only know how to describe what you want in an appropriate
language.

.in +15       
Seymour Papert, July, 1971, ($1.75) (AIM 249)
.sp
Being a mathematician is no more definable as knowing a set 
of mathematical facts than being a poet is definable as knowing a set of 
linguistic facts.  Some modern math ed reformers will give this statement
a too easy assent with the comment:  Yes, they must understand, not merely know.  But this misses the capital point that being a mathematician,
again like being a poet or a composer or an engineer, means doing, rather
than knowing or understanding.  This essay is an attempt to explore some ways
in which one might be able to put children in a better position to do 
mathematics rather than merely learn about it.

Logo Memo 5:    NIM:  A Game Playing Program, Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon,
.in +15
February 1972 ($1.25) (AIM 254)
.sp
This note illustrates some ideas about how to initiate beginning
students into the art of planning and writing a program complex
enough to be considered a project rather than an exercise on using
the language or simple programming ideas.  The project is to write
a program to play a simple game (one-pile NIM of 21) as invincibly
as possible.  We developed the project for a class of seventh grade
children we taught in 1968-60 at the Muzzy High School in Lexington, MA.
(This work was supported by NSF contract No. NSF-C-558 to Bolt, Beranek
and Newman, Inc.)  This was the longest programming project these
children had encountered, and our intention was to
give them a model of how to go about working under these conditions.
To achieve this purpose we ourselves worked very hard to develop a
clear organization of sub-goals which we explained to the class
at the beginning of a three week period devoted to this particular
program.  One would not expect beginners to find as clear a subgoal
structure as this one;  but once they have seen a good example, they
are more likely to do so in the future for other problems.  Thus our
primary teaching purpose was to develop the idea of splitting a task
into subgoals.  We wanted the children to have good models of
various ways in which this can be done and to experience the heuristic
power of this kind of planning (as opposed to jumping straight into
writing programs.)

Logo Memo 6:   Developing a Musical Ear: A New Experiment, Jeanne Bamberger,

July 1972 ($1.25) (AIM 264)
.sp
This is a report on some ideas we have been developing at 
M.I.T. for self-paced independent music study.  The aim of our approach is
to nurture in students that enigmatic quality called, musical -- be 
it a musical ear or an individual's capacity to five a musical 
performance.  While all of us cherish these qualities, rarely do we
come to grips with them directly in teaching. More often we rely
on our magical or mystical faith in the inspiration of music, itself,
and its great artist, to do the teaching.  And for some (maybe
ultimately all) this is the best course.  But what about the others
too whom we teach only the techniques of playing instruments or some
facts about music  --  its forms, its history and its apparent elements?
How often do we have to take the time to examine the assumptions
underlying these facts we teach, or to question the relations between
what we teach and what we do as musicians?

.in +15
Radia Perlman, March 1974 ($1.25)  (AIM 311)
.sp  
TORTIS is a device for preschool children to communicate 
with and program the turtle.  It consists of several boxes (currently 3
button boxes and two blox boxes) designed so that only a few new concepts
are introduced at a time but more can be added when the child
becomes familiar with what he has.  Hopefully transitions are
gradual enough so that the child never thinks talking to the turtle
is too hard or that he is "too dumb."  And hopefully playing with
the system should teach such concepts as numbers, breaking large
problems into small solvable steps, writing and debugging procedures,
recursion, variables, and conditionals.  Most important of all,
it should teach that learning is fun.

.in +15
.sp
This paper was originally written as an address to a 
conference of the National Association of Schools of Music on "The Music
Consumer."  Posing a series of questions which point to a fundamental issue 
underlying the Logo music project, the paper goes on to describe some
of the specific projects with which students have been working in an
effort to probe these issues.  Emphasis is placed on "modes of representation"
as a significant realm of enquiry:  just how does an individual
represent a tune to himself, what are the differences between formal
and informal modes of representation -- what features and relations of
a melody does a representation capture, what does it leave out?  What
is the influence of such modes of "perception," how do they effect
strategies of problem solving, notions of "same" and "different" or
even influence musical "taste"?  Finally, there are some hints at what
might constitute "sufficiently powerful representations" of musical
design with examples from both simple and complex pieces of music as
well as a probe into what might distinguish "simple" form "complex"
musical designs.

Logo Memo 13:   What's In A Tune, Jeanne Bamberger, July 1974 ($2.75)  (AIM 314)
.in +15
.sp
What's In A Tune is a step by step account of two
musically naive MIT students engaged in a musical problem-solving
situation.  The paper focuses on such things as problem-solving
strategies, modes of representations, problems of defining a problem,
tacit models of a "sensible tune."  At the same time the paper looks
at the assumptions inherent in the "categories" of description used
traditionally by musicians in the light of the "categories"
spontaneously generated by the students themselves.  The problem
situation (creating a tune that "makes sense" from a given set of
"tune blocks") becomes one of more general interest because it
provides the opportunity to examine closely how individuals deal with
the issue of "design" where the features, the constraints, the goals
must emerge as part of the problem-solving process itself.  This
is in contrast to problems where there is consensus as to what
constitutes a good solution, where the elements of material are
already defined and where there is general agreement on good
heuristics for dealing with the problem.  Observations of the two
students can thus be seen as a concrete instance of learning and
thinking within those prevalent real-world situations where the
structure of the task is itself a product of the learning and thinking
process.  As such the paper is necessarily concerned with the
interrelations between cognition, perception and representation.

Abelson, Andrea diSessa, Lee Rudolph, December, 1974 ($1.75)
.sp
We develop a theory of orbits for the inverse-square central force law
which differs considerably from the usual deductive approach.  In
particular, we make no explicit use of calculus.  By beginning with
qualitative aspects of solutions, we are led to a number
of geometrically realizable physical invariants of the orbits.
Consequently, most of our theorems rely only on geometrical
relationships.  Despite its simplicity, our planetary geometry is
powerful enough to treat a wide range of perturbations with relative
ease.  Furthermore, without introducing any more machinery, we obtain
full quantitative results.  The paper concludes with suggestions for
further research into the geometry of planetary orbits.

.in +15
Revised May 1975 ($2.50) (AIM 338)
.sp
DRAGONS are formidable problems in elementary mechanics not amenable
to solution by naive formula cranking.  What is the intellectual
weaponry one needs to snare a Dragon?  To snare a Dragon one brings to
mind an heuristic frame -- a specifically structured association of
problem solving ideas.  Data on the anatomy of heuristic frames --
just how and what ideas are linked together --  has been obtained from
the protocols of many attacks on Dragons by students and physicists.
In this paper various heuristic frames are delineated by detailing how
they motivate attacks on particular Dragons, Milko and Jugglo, from
the writers compilation.  This model of the evolution of problem
solving skills has also been applied to the interpretation of the
intellectual growth of children, and in an Appendix we use it to give
a cogent interpretation for the protocols of Piagetian "Conservation"
experiments.  The model provides a sorely needed theoretical framework
to discuss teaching stratagems calculated to promote problem solving
skills.

strategies are significant to the general development of musical
intelligence and may also suggest implications for learning and

analyzers.  In order to apply PAZATN to a particular task domain, one
must supply a set of event specialists (ESPs) which embody
syntactically organized analytic knowledge specific to that domain.
The approach has implications for psychological modeling and
evaluation, and the design of computerized tutors.  The initial task

Over the next five years, computer games will find their way into a
vast number of American homes, creating a unique educational
opportunity:  the development of "computer coaches" for the serious
intellectual skills required by some of these games.  From the players
perspective, the coach will be available to analyze alternative moves
whenever the player wishes help.  But, from the perspective of the
coach, the request for help is an opportunity to illustrate by
example basic mathematical scientific or other kinds of knowledge that
the game exercises.  The potential for establishing an "athletic"
paradigm for certain knowledge and skills which have usually been
considered the antithesis of ordinary sports is exciting, but there
are critical research issues which must be addressed.  Although the
hardware needed for homes and coaches will continue to drop in cost,
the software technology for designing competent coaches does not
exist.  The substance of this proposal is to develop the theory and
design for such coaches, to implement prototypes and to experiment
with their utility in conveying important intellectual skills.

Lawler, November 1976, ($4.00) (AIM 395)

Pre-Readers exhibit concepts of the English word different from those
of literate adults.  The inclusive word concept is primary: a word is
what we call an utterance and any of its parts.  Pre-Readers suffer
confusion between homophones at the syllabic level, e.g., the sound of
the suffix in "puppy" is confused with the name of the letter "P."
Conflict between implicit judgments of wordhood (inferred from the
child's counting of the number of words in an utterance) and explicit
judgments (responses to questions about whether an item is a word)
vary from high, for pre-readers, to low, for beginning readers.  The
justifications pre-readers offer to support their judgments of
word-hood are notable for not including any arguments based on
immediate verbal context.  A concept development theory is offered to
interpret this data and their relation to learning to read.

Description, Jeanne Bamberger, December 1976, ($1.25) (AIM 398)

Trying to capture intuitive knowledge is a little like trying to
capture the moment between what just happened and what is about to
happen.  Or to quote a famous philosopher, "You can't put your foot in
the same river once."*  The problem is that you can only "capture"
what stands still.  Intuitive knowledge is not a static structure, but
rather a continuing process of constructing coherence and meaning out
of the sensory phenomena that come at you.  To capture intuitive
knowledge then means:  Given some phenomena, what are your 
spontaneous ways of selecting significant features or for choosing
what constitutes an element, how do you determine what is the same and
what is different, how do you aggregate or chunk the sensory data
before you?

control knowledge--knowing what to do.

An NSF sponsored 12-Month project.  This research will thoroughly
document the experiences of a small number of 5th grade children in an
elementary school computer laboratory, using Logo, an advanced
computer language designed for children.  Detailed anecdotal records
will be kept, and observers will note the development of the
children's computer programming skills, and the acquisition of
knowledge in the areas of mathematics, science and language, and of
cognitive strategies and attitudinal changes which transfer beyond the
specific subject matter studied.

The Logo activities of a group of 16 sixth-grade students,
representing a full spectrum of ability, are being documented with a
view of developing ways of capturing the learning possibilities of
such an environment.  The first group of eight subjects have completed
25 closely observed hours, extending over 7 weeks, in a Logo classroom
situated in a Brookline school.  This is an interim report on these
observations designed to exhibit the content of what has been learned;
and insights into both the variety of cognitive styles of the pupils
and the variety of learning situations available to a teacher with
which to respond to different pupil styles and analysis, and we are
interested in looking at this material from several points of view.
The current state of our various analyses is presented here, without
any effort to prune the considerable redundancy which has been
generated in the process of doing this multiple-cut exercise.

In this paper we look at some of the ingredients and processes
involved in the understanding of mathematics.  We analyze elements of
mathematical knowledge, organize them in a coherent way and take note
of certain classes of items that share noteworthy roles in
understanding.  We thus build a conceptual framework in which to talk
about mathematical knowledge.  We then use this representation to
describe the acquisition of understanding.  We also report on
classroom experience with these ideas.

In this proposal to the BEH we describe a technological step towards
the realization of INFORMATION PROSTHETICS.  Our primary focus is on
using rather than making the technology.  Specifically, our
goal is to transpose for the use of cerebral-palsied children a
computer-based learning environment we have developed, and to study in
this environment a series of issues in developmental psychology, in
the psychology of learning, in psycho-diagnostic techniques and in
methods of instruction.

This memo gives a series of experiments which one can use to get a
better understanding of how music works and how music is apprehended
by an active and knowing listener.  It does so by using the children's
computer language, Logo, and capitalizes on the use of procedural
thinking and other programming concepts in the designing and analysis
of melody and rhythm.

During the school year 1977/78 four computers equipped with Logo and
Turtle Graphics were installed in an elementary school in Brookline,
MA.  All sixth grade students in the school had between 20 and 40
hours of hands-on experience with the computers.  The work of 16
students was documented in detail.  The volume includes: (1) an
overview of the Brookline Logo project, (2) a description of the
learning styles of different students who took part in the project,
(3) the experience of students at both extremes of the range of
abilities present in a typical public school, (4) a breakdown of the
computer programming skills and concepts learned by the students
during the course of the project, (5) a breakdown of the mathematical
and geometrical skills and concepts learned by the students during the
course of the project, and (6) a description of the results of a
brief exposure of students to a dynamic turtle which simulates
Newtonian motion. (See Logo Memo 54 Part III of this report.)

During the school year 1977/78 four computers equipped with Logo
Turtle Graphics were installed in an elementary school in Brookline,
MA.  All sixth grade students in the school had between 20 and 40
hours of hands-on experience with the computers.  The work of 16
students was documented in detail.  The profiles, written by the
classroom teacher, are discursive essays on the experiences of each of
the sixteen experimental subjects.  This illustrates the wide variety
of learning styles and learning paths within the Logo learning
environment.  They are particularly useful for teachers who anticipate
using Logo with children, and offer a rich source of project ideas
suitable for naive programmers.  (See Logo Memo 53 for Part II of this

Ongoing work using computers in the education of the physically
handicapped is summarized in this report and the next phase of
activity is outlined.  We address three issues of research with
severely cerebral palsied children;  namely (1) the investigation of
computer-based techniques to maximize their acquisition of spatial
and linguistic skills (2) the development of computer-based
diagnostic tools to facilitate the functional specification of
subcategories of this group and (3) investigating how these results
can inform our theories of the cognitive development of normal individuals.

This is a case study of how one child learned to write in a
computer-rich setting.  Although computer access did affect her
learning significantly, the details presented here go beyond
supporting that claim.  They provide a simple example of what a
computer-based introduction to writing might be like for other
children.  We conclude with a short discussion of issues raised by the
study.

An intensive, naturalistic study tracked one six year old's learning
for six months and more.  The study was inspired by the hope that with
concepts of Artificial Intelligence and sufficiently detailed
observation we could describe the path of knowledge development
through observing significant learning experiences.  The corpus
includes a reasonably complete record of the child's public
calculations, both formal and informal, during the period of the
study.  We present an interpretation of addition-related matter from
the corpus.  The interpretive focus is on the learning processes
through which a broadly applicable skill emerges from the integration
of knowledge based on specific, particular experiences.

1980, ($1.75) (AIM 590)
.sp
Mathematics is much more than the manipulation of numbers.  At its
best, it involves simple, clear examples of thought so apt to the
world we live in that those examples provide guidance for our thinking
about problems we meet subsequently.  We call such examples, capable
of heuristic use, POWERFUL IDEAS, after Papert (1980).  This article
documents a child's introduction to a specific powerful idea in a
computer environment.  We trace his extensions of that idea to other
problem areas, the first similar to his initial experience and the
second more remote from it.

We analyze in detail one child's learning to play Tic tac toe by
focusing on the developing organization of disparate cognitive
structures.  This interpretation extends an earlier analysis of the
same child's learning (Lawler, 1981) in two directions.  We propose
and apply a vision of how social engagement leads to the personal
construction of mind.  Further, we trace how knowledge based on one's
own actions can develop into structures capable of predicting another
agent's choices and relate that development to domain-specific,
stage-like changes in modes of thought.  The six year old subject
initially knew so little of Tic tac toe that she couldn't continue
playing when confronted by an unanticipated response to her opening
move in a game.  Six months later she was playing both sides of the
game, making smart moves for both players.  Two years later, she
invented a new strategy and was able to prove predictions of victories
by detailing the offensive use of forced moves in games worked out in
her mind.  The corpus of observations assembled during this period is
rich in detail and reasonably complete in covering the child's overt behavior.

($4.00) (AIM 640)

This memo reports the results of a case study into how children learn
in the absence of explicit teaching.  The three subjects, an eight
year old, a ten year old and a thirteen year old, were observed in
both of two experimental micro-worlds.  The first of these
micro-worlds, called the Chemicals World, included a large table, a
collection of laboratory and household chemicals, and apparatus for
conducting experiments with chemicals;  the second, called the Mork
and Mindy World included a collection of video-taped episodes of the
television series Mork and Mindy; a video-tape machine and an
experimenter with whom the subjects could discuss the episodes.  The
main result of the study is a theory of how children's interests
interact with knowledge embodied in their environment causing them to
learn new powerful ideas.  An early version of this theory is
presented in chapter five.
