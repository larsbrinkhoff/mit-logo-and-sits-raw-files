The turtle is an object that can draw pictures on the TV screen. You can think of the turtle as a "robot" that can move forward and back and
turn right or left. With its pen down, it can draw geometric shapes in color, as it
moves around the screen.  This booklet tells you how to use the Logo computer language to control the turtle and to write your own procedures for the computer. Many projects are suggested, and after using this booklet, you will be able to invent many more of your own.
