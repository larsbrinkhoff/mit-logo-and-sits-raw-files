2Running the Logo Laboratory

.chapter "Running the Logo Laboratory"
.section "What is the Logo Laboratory?"

0The following is a very brief introduction to the goals of the Logo Laboratory.
There are numerous papers which describe its purposes in more detail.

The Logo laboratory is a research group whose primary objective is to
articulate its educational philosophy through the use of computer technology.
In a sense, it is the education-wing of a new and growing computer culture
which is utopian in nature; that is, it hopes to influence the transformation
of existing culture in ways that will offer children (of all ages!!)
opportunities for self-enrichment and mutual growth.

At the same time, the
Logo Laboratory tries to be realistic.  It must respect where people and the
society are in order to provide meaningful suggestions and direction.
The technology and the ideas participate in interactive change; that is, the
ideas influence changes in the technology (the hardware and the software), and
the technology influences changes in the ideas.

The two most identifiable roots of Logo are the ideas and techniques found in
the community of researchers in
Artificial Inteligence (AI) and the cognitive psychologists
who have been guided by the ideas of the late Jean Piaget.  Through attempts to
identify the ways people learn, AI researchers try to develop computational models
for intelligence.  Learning theories which are proposed are seen as pieces of
a very complicated mosaic which, it is hoped, will eventually take on a
clear pattern and reveal the processes
by which people think, learn and create.

Piaget's work, Piagetian psychology, has provided insights into the importance
of the interaction between the individual and his/her environment in the learning
process.  Learning is active, is initiated by the learner, and the environment
plays a significant role in shaping the possibilities the learner has to choose
from in order to exercise his/her interest in knowing.

The Logo laboratory hopes to construct increasingly rich computer-enhanced
educational environments so that what Prof. Papert calls "Piagetian Learning"
can take place for any learner regardless of his/her pre-requisite knowledge
upon entering such a learning environment.

The remainder of this document is designed to be a practical guide for
running the laboratory.  This is the responsibility of the administrative-secretary.

.section "Publications"

0A primary function is to distribute Logo publications to the public.
Publications that are strictly AI are distributd by Rosemarie Barry (Room
818 in 545 Technology Square).  All such requests should be forwarded to her.  The Logo
bibliography of papers indicates the cost of each publication (the
cost of printing and handling).  When people are interested in Logo
publications, send the bibliography.  When people ask for specific
papers, send them the papers and tell them how much they owe.  If
people ask for many (say, 3 or more) specific papers, send the
bibliography.  We cannot afford to give away many papers for free
which is what happens when people don't take reimbursing us seriously.
It's also too much trouble to keep track of people who owe us
publications money.  By taking only small risks, the loses will only
be small ones.

.section "Multilithing"

0Multilithing is a copying service which is located on the 4th floor (room 417 of 545 Technology Square).
This is the way we make many copies of papers.  If you need less than 10 copies
of something, use the xerox machines.  Of course, if you need less than, say,
50 copies of one page, also use the xerox machines.  But if you need more than
10 copies of several pages, use multilithing.  They have three classes of work:
A-service which means "within 24 hours", B-service which means "within 3 days"
and C-service which means "weeks".  If you are well organized, you should not
need to use anything but B service.  Occasionally A service is required for
urgent things -- like proposals.
.end_keep

Try to save the multilith ladies the trouble of copying the same paper month
after month.  If you know that you will need 20 copies of something this week,
and 30 copies of the same thing next month, get 50 copies made at one time.
The more copies you make of one thing, the less it costs per copy and, also,
the less trouble you cause them.

A model of the multilith form is included in the looseleaf notebook.

Since we have moved out of Tech. Square they handle our work as a favor, and
it has lower priority than Laboratory for Computer Science work.  If you want
something done in a rush, fill out a requisition and call Graphic Arts
(ext. 2806) which is located in the basement of building 3.  If you
are in a big hurry, you can bring it over yourself, but if you are in
a hurry and also have no time, there is a pickup and delivery service
whose number is 3-4765.  If you find yourself doing this often, you
may want to set up an account with Graphic Arts. (Talk to Marion
Wasserman about that.)

.section "Xerox Copying"

0The xerox machine is in 20C-101.  You need something
which is called an AUDITRON to make the copies.  It is a gadget which you put
in the machine.  It counts the number of copies you make.  If you have
one of your own at the end of each month you will be asked
the number of copies you have made for the
month and the account number on which the copying costs should be charged.  You
may need to ask Marion what that account number is.  Otherwise, you
will need to borrow the auditron from Debbie Bannerjee or Diane
Mitchell in 20C-126.

.section "Mailing"

0Send all U.S. requests PRINTED MATTER.  Send all non-U.S. requests
"AIR MAIL, PRINTED MATTER".  For quick mailing -- mailing of proposals
or other URGENT things -- there are three options.  There is a 24 hour
service to many (but not all places) called FEDERAL EXPRESS.  The
package is taken to the Central Square Post Office.  Better and
cheaper is EXPRESS MAIL.  It is also a 24 hour service run by the post
office, but you can take packages to the Kendall Square office, or
even to the Student Center post office.  It usually costs
betwen $10-30.  For evening and same-day service call AIR COURIER at
800-528-6070.  It usually costs over $100 so the package better be
very important.  If you need advice on this call Marion Wasserman at
x3-7362.
.end_keep

.section "Requisitions"

0Requisitions are used to request the purchase of things and services.  All approvals
for requisitions are to be received from Marion Wasserman (x3-7362).  Let her know
how much you are going to spend, for what, and who made the initial request.
Use the model for typing requisitions included in the looseleaf notebook.
.end_keep

.keep
.section "Travel"

0We usually make all travel arrangements through Heritage Travel,
located in Kendall Square.  Their numbers are: x3-7961 (domestic),
x3-7964 (international).  We don't have travel money for most things
so it wil be necessary to check with Marion Wasserman (x3-7362) to get
approval.  If she gives her approval and an account number, you can
request that the tickets be delivered to the Division.  If there is no
approval, make sure the traveler knows.  You can still, however, make
the plane reservations.  To save time, it is usually useful to find
out a couple of different travel routes and times, especially in the
case of complicated travel itineraries.  This way you don't have to go
back to Heritage Travel a second and third time in order to gather new
information.  Be aggressive about obtaining travel information.  The
agencies are often lazy about offering good alternatives.
.end_keep

After the person has taken Lab-sponsored travel a travel voucher has
to be filled out.  It should include receipts for which the traveler
is requesting reimbursement.  You do not need receipts for taxi cabs.
If the traveler does not have all the receipts see if there is a way
for him/her to get most or all of his/her money back by requesting a
PER DIEM reimbursement for each full day s/he has traveled.  A PER
DIEM is an amount of money MIT decides should cover a traveler's food
and housing expenses per day.  This amount changes through the year
(it usually goes up) and is different from place to place.  For
example, overseas travel has a much higher per diem.  Use the model
for typing out travel vouchers included in the looselead notebook.

.section "Mail"

0The mail comes each day around 11:00 am.  Sort out the group mail
and distribute it to each member's office.  Hold onto Seymour's mail
and general Logo group mail.
.end_keep

Seymour does not look at his mail regularly.  The secret to keeping
things under control is to know what to throw out and what is
important.  All of his mail should be opened and dated.  Later on this
will help you to know what is or isn't urgent.  He receives the
following kinds of mail:
.in .5i

.keep
1.  Junk mail:  advertisements, etc.

2.  Articles which he has been asked to read or review or as a result of him being
on other groups mailing lists.
.end_keep

.keep
3.  Invitations to speak or be involved in something
and material relating to invitations or projects he has already accepted.

4.  General Logo mail addressed to him.
.in 0i

Junk mail should be thrown out.
.end_keep

The articles should be put in a separate stack.  The authors names should be circled.
When he comes in, you can ask him if he wants to keep any of them.  Throw out the rest.
Tell him you are going to do this so that he will take your question seriously.

A file should be made for each
accepted invitation and project (class #3).  The name of the file should be one
that is easy to remember.

.keep
.in .5i
3a. Accepted invitations require
travel files.  They should be labelled with the
PLACE and DATE.  Check to see that the dates have been entered in Seymour's
appointment book.  (Seymour is also carrying around his own appointment book.  Make
sure that it is in that.)  I also have been keeping a file on the computer in Seymour's
directory called Papert;Sched >.  At the top I put THINGS TO DO and for the rest of it
I put his travel plans in chronological order.
.end_keep

.keep
3b. Material relating to Seymour's current personal projects should also be labelled
and filed after he sees them.  There is a place in the filing cabinet labelled
PAPERT's PROJECTS and PAPERS where these should go.

3c.  New invitations should be labelled at the top with the PLACE and DATE of the
engagement.  Write a short summary of the invitation.  Also look for
whether they cover transportation, lodgings or provide an honorarium.  A typical
comment might be: "TALK FOR SAN FRANCISCO HIGH SCHOOL MATH TEACHERS, ALL TRAVEL AND $100
HONORARIUM".  The next comment you might write is "YES or NO (please circle)".
Taking this trouble will greatly reduce your's and his work.
.end_keep

.in 0i
You can answer general mail, whether it comes to the group, Seymour, or is addressed
to any of the present (or even past) group members and is given to you to respond to.
There are the following types.

.keep
.in .5i
4a.  Mail relating to publications.  For this, see the section entitled "Publications".

4b.  People ask to be put on mailing lists or it is implied that they would want to
be on a mailing list by the tone of their letters.  See the section entitled "Mailing
Lists" for this.

4c.  These are responses which Seymour asks you to make regarding his plans or letters he
wishes you to type.
.end_keep
.in 0i

.keep
.section "Mailing Lists"

0There are three mailing lists (files) on the computer.  People's addresses are
put on the computer in alphabetical order.  The physical letter itself is filed
in the filing cabinet.
Each letter should be dated with the time it was
received and labelled with the mailing list which it is associated with.
.end_keep

.keep
.in .5i
1.  Logo Mailing List <Date>.  Letters that indicate general interest in the project
and requests for publications.  The computer: <directory>;MAILLO

2.  Apple-Logo Mailing List <Date>. This should actually have been labelled "Micro-Computer
Implementations of Logo" because that is the reason people on this list are writing.
The computer: <directory>;MAILAP

3.  Handicapped Logo Mailing List <Date>.  These are letters which request information
about our work with handicapped children; for example, our work
with children having cerebral palsy. The computer: <directory>;MAILCP.
.in 0i
.end_keep

Note: most of the above applies if Seymour is around.  If he's not, then
(with the exception of mail you answer yourself or throw out) his mail should
be forwarded to him.  Currently that means to Bonnie Brownstein/ Logo Computer
Systems/989 Ave. of the Americas/ N.Y. N.Y. 10018 (phone: (212)564-6020), but
especially if he is in Paris, that could change.
.keep
.section "Phone Messages"

0The main Logo phone is x3-7360.  Seymour's line is x3-6215.  There
is a service called CALL-FORWARDING which makes it possible for people
to have their phones answer on any other extension.  See section
entitled "Call-Forwarding" for details on this service.
.end_keep

All messages should include the following information.  Who made the call, when
they made it (including the DATE and TIME), who they are calling and why.  The
"WHY" is hard to get from some people but it is useful to get a brief statement.  It
helps the person receiving the call.  The time is also important, especially
if the person is a frequent caller.

Since Seymour receives many calls, it's useful to keep a log of them
using, say, a stenographer's notebook.  It may also be useful to
create a new file on the computer in Seymour's directory (PAPERT) in
which you can type his calls from day to day.  It's probably enough to
just put these calls in Seymour's computer mail; that is; send him
MAIL.  See paper entitled "Crash Course on How to Use the System".

Messages to group members should be placed on their desks or taped on
their office doors.  It's very easy to forget to do this, but it's
important.  The more things you can get off of your desk and into the
hands of the people who should get it, the easier your job will be.

.keep
.section "Call-Forwarding"

0People in the group can have their phones ring in your office.  You
can also do the same.  This will be useful for you when you are
working on the computer but need to cover the phones as well.  To
call-forward, call from your phone to the phone you want the line to
jump to by dialing: 72-3-<temporary-number>.  "Temporary-number" is
the last four digits of the phone you will be sitting near
temporarily.  To un-call-forward -- that is return things to normal --
dial 73 from your OWN phone and wait for a dial tone.
.end_keep

.keep
.section "Bulletin Board"

0It is your job to keep the bulletin boards current.  Post as much general
information as possible.  This information usually includes: seminars, job
announcements, fliers of new papers, etc.  It can also include movie guides
and other informal stuff.  Clear away anything that is out-of-date.  Also post
proposal deadlines which are given in the Weekly paper "Chronicle of Higher
Education" which comes to the lab.
.end_keep

.keep
.section "Filing Cabinets"

0The filing cabinets in your office are used frequently, both by you and
group members.  Make sure that nothing is taken from them that is irreplacable.
Ask the person walking away with something whether they plan to return it.  This
will help remind them that they should.
.end_keep

The cabinets have a current organization which could easily change if you found
it desirable to do so.   The important thing is to be able to go them quickly
when you need to.  It will be
helpful to investigate them before you need to use them.

.keep
.section "Keys"

.section "Security"

If you are in D.S.R.E. then you will only have to worry about your own door
and possibly the door to the Apple-Room.  Debbie Bannerjee or Diane Mitchell
will explain how to manage the alarm system in the Apple room.  The building 
is not secure, so you should be careful with valuables.

If this job is reopened in some other location or under different 
circumstances, you may want to take a look at an earlier version of this
manual to get an idea of what our policies have been about keys and security.
(There will be a copy of the older version immediately after Crash Course
in How to Use the System in the looseleaf binder, and also in the Logo 
directory on AI.
