^^^^^^^^^^We analyze one child's learning in a computer-rich setting by focussing upon reorganizations among disparate cognitive structures.  We document and trace her introduction to XY-coordinates and her developing comprehension of iteration.  This interpretation extends  in a new direction earlier analyses of the same child's learning (Lawler, 1981a, Lawler, 1981b).  Interpreting the empirical material through a vision of the developing organization of ideas, we address the issue of how some ideas function with more power than others in an individual mind.  Although she understood adequately the simple movement and turning commands of turtle geometry, the six year old subject initially was confused by the XY-coordinate description of space, nor did she appreciate how computer generated designs emerged from the repetition of those movement and turning commands.  During the six month core of the study, the subject came to use XY-coordinates effectively.  Some months later, she gave evidence of understanding how simple movements generated complex designs.  The corpus of observations assembled during this period is extensive, rich in detail, and reasonably complete in covering the child's overt behavior relating to the themes of geometry and iteration.

"...Clusters [of cognitive structures] should emerge from the interactions between the world and almost any memory-using mechanism; it would require more explanation were they not found....Developmentally, one would assume, the earliest frames [cognitive structures] would tend to become the capitols of their later relatives, unless  this is firmly prevented by experience....  The acquisition of new centers is largely forced upon us from the outside: by the words available in one's language; by the behavior of objects in one's environment; by what one is told by one's teachers, family, and general culture.  Of course, at each step the structure of the previous structure dominates the acquisition of the latter...."310

IA.^^^^^^^^^^How do developmentally earlier cognitive structures come to be supplanted by new central structures ?  Reorganization is a crucial question for any vision of mind which argues that the genetic path of experience is embodied in the structure of mind (Lawler, 1981a).  This paper makes explicit the connection between the structural centers of Minsky (1975)and the "powerful ideas" of Papert (1980).  **Since the identification of stable nuclei of cognitive structure clusters with powerful ideas may seem an obvious move, the value this paper claims is less in its novelty than in the concrete exemplification of the filiation and reorganization of clusters of cognitive structures.

IB.^^^^^CORPUS^^^^^The empirical material of this article is drawn from The Intimate Study, a  detailed observational record of six-months in one child's learning.  The setting of the formal sessions was MIT's Logo project, at that time the computers and education wing of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  All the sessions were recorded on audiotape and transcribed; a good number were recorded on videotape.  Of the sixty-five sessions at Logo, many involved the subject interacting with a computer.  Detailed naturalistic observation of the subject traced the effect of formal sessions into her life beyond the confines of the laboratory.  Doing so was possible because Miriam, the primary subject, is my daughter.  During the study, she, her brother, and I were constant companions.  I was the "primary caretaker".  Miriam was otherwise somewhat isolated (we lived in the carriage house of a remote estate and most of her kindergarden friends were gone for the summer).  Before and after that summer, my frequent penetration of her social world, playing with her and her friends both at home and in school, contributed to the unusual degree of completeness of coverage The Intimate Study can claim for this material.  My decade in the computer industry and later years at the Logo project equipt me to approach the issues about learning in a computer-rich environment.

IC.^^^^^CHARACTERIZATION^^^^^Miriam was delighted and proud to enter significantly into her father's world.  Although we sometimes quarelled and she often resisted my specific suggestions (for she is not easily lead), our relationship during The Intimate Study was free, open, and trusting -- even to the extent that Miriam was willing to think aloud, knowingly revealing her ignorance.  She was a bright and curious six year old, performing on many tasks from the Piagetian repertoire as would a typical eight or nine year old.  One might think of her then as an unschooled eight year old, with some specific lacunae in her academic knowledge.  (For example, she had not been introduced to negative numbers.)  Miriam had taught herself to read at the age of four and a half.  During this study, she developed a surprising agility at mental calculation.  (See the detail presented in Lawler, 1979 and 1981.)  She enjoyed playing with friends, reading, TV and movies (the Marx Brothers especially), shopping, telling jokes and playing tricks on her brother and her "dumb old Dad".  During the preceding years, Miriam came frequently to the Logo lab, knew many people there, and played with computer games I designed for her and others.  Consequently, it was a natural extension of our normal interactions to intensify them somewhat over a summer when the children were to be much in my care.

IC2.^^^^^^^^^^Although the primary focus of The Intimate Study was Miriam, from her sixth birthday for six month, she was not the only subject.  Robby, my son and two years her senior, participated in as many Logo sessions, in as many of the Piagetian pre and post tests, and indeed played a significant role in many of the incidents recorded by naturalistic observation.  The primary difference in the role of the two subjects derives from my commitment to a more thorough and complete analysis of Miriam's empirical records than of Robby's.  (This by no means implies that Robby's work was less interesting.  At eight, systematic thought was beginning to dominate his problem solving.  This change of balance interacted powerfully with his experiences at Logo.  See, for a prime example, Extending a Powerful Idea, Lawler, 1980.)

ID.^^^^^RELATIONS TO OTHER WORK^^^^^This article continues the series begun  with The Progressive Construction of Mind (Lawler, 1981a) and The Articulation of Complementary Roles (Lawler, 1981b).  Of these two predecessors, it relates more to the first.  In that article, I described Miriam's learning addition as the development and progressive organization of knowledge structures which I called microworlds.  Interpreting the progressive development of a cluster of such microworlds, I argued that the control structure embodied the genetic path of microworld filiation.  Here we focus on re-structuring of those cognitive organizations -- addressing the questions of how the idea of reorganization is compatible with genetic filiation and what some characteristics of experience and mental structures might be that affect this process.  Where The Progressive Construction of Mind focussed on addition, a theme of common concern, here we treat an unusual topic of analysis.  There are few studies which ask what significant ideas can children learn from computer experiences.  (Unlearning Aristotelian Physics, diSessa, 1981, is an outstanding exception).  Children's understanding of computational ideas is a theme only now coming to be recognized as especially significant in its own right.  The pioneering work of Papert (**list**) is more intellectual (i.e. epistemological and ideological) and anecdotal than systematic or empirical.  This work, and its companion, Enculturation and Learning (Lawler, in preparation), begin with Papert's conviction about the importance of computational ideas and follow some of his arguments to explore processes of learning in what may be a major new domain of intellectual experience.

ID2.^^^^^^^^^^If all microworlds internally are structurally similar -- and thus all the ideas they embody are in this specific sense "equal" -- how can it be that some ideas are especially powerful, i.e. "more equal than others" ?  It is begging this question to merely identify powerful ideas as embodied in structurally central microworlds unless one can explain how a microworld becomes the center of a cluster.  Minsky observes (as in the epigraph above) that developmentally prior structures, by default, own a privileged position in a cluster.  Some are central because they provide proto-typical models for interpreting later experiences and this serve as logical ancestors of microworlds constructed on the basis of subsequent experiences.  (Such is exemplified by the relation of the COUNT and MONEY microworlds in The Progressive Construction of Mind).  But the measure  of centrality of a structure can not be merely that its acquisition preceded some other.  The criterion must be that it continually dominates other microworlds -- as for example Bartlett's stereotypes (1932) came in time to dominate the particular stories recalled by his subjects.  The word stereotype focusses on the enduring stability of specific ideas (and thus the structures behind them) without making any commitment to explain that stability.  One cannot judge an idea to be a stereotype without witnessing its persistence for a long time and its domination of competitiors.  Consequently I here apply the word archetype to mean a related but different thing: an ARCHETYPE is a microworld which is destined to become a stereotype, destined to function as the nucleus of a microworld cluster.  We assume an archetype owns such a fate because it embodies a powerful idea.

ID3.^^^^^^^^^^Bacon's dictum tells un that knowledge is power, but ideas can only function through the action of agents, through their embodiment in mind, even more, through their specific embodiments in particular minds.  Papert (1980) describes powerful ideas as having four characteristics: applicability, generality, simplicity, and syntonicity.  If I interpret rightly his meaning, a powerful idea is useful, applicable to solving specific problems.  It is general in the sense of being easily extensible to other problems.  That is, it constitutes a kind of radical metaphor which provides effective guidance in many other specific settings.  It is simple is a logical sense: the entities to which it applies are crisply defined; the realtions between them are "intuitively obvious"; the length of chains of inference from any premise to any conclusion possible is minimal.  These defining criteria relate primarily to the information processing characteristics of the structures embodying an idea.  Syntonicity names the dimension of how an idea relates to a particular mind.  An idea can only be powerful in a particular mind if it is SYNTONIC, i.e. felt by the person to be a valued part of the self.  If we hope to understand thinking, that is, the interplay of functioning ideas, we must attend to their acquisition and balance, and changes in that balance over time.  The important question then is how, precisely, does the organization of specific ideas change in a particular mind.  **We pursue an answer to this question through tracing one child's learning of two ideas, the second of which we consider a powerful idea, which we propose as an example of an idea embodied in a microworld derived from an experience which gives it the qualities of an archetype.

IE.^^^^^Domain.^^^^^^^^^^My application of the term "geometry" to our work, as much as it was limited in scope, is justified by Miriam's having dealt with the primitive space descriptions of Turtle Geometry and Coordinate Geometry.  The latter designates any point in a plane as an ordered pair of numbers.  The first number is commonly referred to as the X-coordinate (X is the horizontal axis); the perpendicular or vertical Y-axis defines the second number of the pair.  Miriam's use of coordinates involved specifying that some object should appear at a destination described by this ordered pair of numbers.

IE2.^^^^^^^^^^Turtle geometry is an action-based geometry developed for use by children. The space is described by movement through it.  The primitive terms of description are actions, that is, executed commands to move forward or back some distance or to turn right or left through some angle.  The commands are implicitly directed to an agent, the TURTLE (embodied as either a mechanical robot which lumbers over the floor or as a triangular cursor which zooms through a bounded space on a computer video display).  The commands are state centered, i.e. go forward so far from wherever-you-are and turn right so much from wherever-you-are-heading.  These are the basic geometric concepts Miriam was to deal with during our project.  Her experiences are described and analysed in the section "Navigating in Two Geometries". 

IE3.^^^^^^^^^^One of the practical challenges of turtle geometry is achieving a bridge between the world of mathematical design and the everyday world of going forward and turning right.  First, notice the profound sense of distinction.  In the world of body geometry, a right turn would be well served by anything between 80 and 100 degrees.  In designs, the difference one degree makes may be profound.  Such a difference in quantification sensititivity suggests the experience of these phenomena must result in disparate structures in the mind.  Further, how different must an "angle" appear when it is first how much a person turns and second, an abstract number on which some incomprehensible procedure operates to create a mysterious product.  Although the labelling of our language, an implicit form of instruction,  promises connection between disparate realms of ideas, it must be through the individual's experience and intellectual labor that bridges between these disparate realms are constructed.  For the two disparate realms of navigating in space and of computer-generated design, the ultimate relation is through iteration.  In the later section "The Idea of Iteration in Generated Designs", we follow Miriam's progress toward such an understanding.  The next section, "Navigating in Two Geometries", characterizes Miriam's geometric knowledge not involving iteration and more importantly, analyses some specific confusions and her resolution of them through a learning process which we will witness also appearing in "The Idea of Iteration".

IE.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^We may conclude this discussion of using distance and angle by describing Miriam's knowledge as in two clusters, of NAVIGATION and DESIGN.  These clusters may be thought of as related by common terms but unconnected.  That is, Miriam could not relate the operations of the NAVIGATION cluster to the artifacts of the DESIGN world, as she did so clearly in this Vignette (126; 6;11;5) at the end of The Intimate Study:

^^^As I sat at work in the reading alcove, Miriam came to join me.  SHe offere to sit in my lap, but I protested to being busy and turned her down.

^^^Miriam moped a little then crawled on my bed and into the center.  She began to move and spin in a most ouzzling and disttracting fashion.  "What are you doing^?  You're driving me batty."  My gripe iinspired her to explain.  Requesting a pen and a 3x5 card, she drew thereon a right rectangular polygonal spiral to show what she was doing in her"crawling on the bed game".  Her verbal description was that she was "making one of those maze things".

This late witnessed connectedness is lacking early in The Intimate Study.  It is clear evidence that Miriam can relate knowledge of NAVIGATION to DESIGN.  How should we think of these microworlds as related before they are explicitly connected by knowledge about the relation of parts and phenomena in both worlds^?  Let me set out my best proposal, though it be one still quite inadequate.  The two worlds are related (I describe thema s being a "cluster" of microworlds) by their major parts potentially fitting as descriptions of parts of some situation.   That is, if confronted by  problem involving "angle", Miriam would be tempted to describe it in two different ways, the one deriving from her concept of angle in NAVIGATION and the second from DESIGN.  I say Miriam is "tempted" because these descriptions are active and propose themselves as ways of seeing the situation such that it decomposes into recognizable parts.  From this point of view, a cluster of microworlds is a system of descriptions competing to apply to a class of problems.  If description simply compete for application, ther is a minimum of structure in their relations.  How structure developes in a cluster of microworlds is a central concern of [*this whole studuy].  In [*section 13] we will pursue the question of how NAVIGATION and DESIGN come to be related as witness by Miriam's "crawling on the bed game".

IA.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^A final problem for this section, one merely to be raised but not resolved here, may be crystalized in the form of this specific question.   "When Miriam began her `somewhast systematic exploration' of angular inputs to the MPOLY procedure (i..e. 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 degrees), from what specific knowledge structures in the mind might such advice come^?"  Such a question, generalized, is a central question of thinking: "How do discrete knowledge structures interact in the solving of problems^?"  What is novel in this question is daring to raise it with some hope of finally answering it.  Mind theories focussing on control structure make it possible to frame competing hypotheses about such a question.  One class of hypothesies would be that such advice comes down from above.  That is, there exists a general body of problem-solving knowledge which some problem-solver in the mind can apply.  Such hypotheses lkeave us with the mysterious difficulty of the problem-solver's origin.  A secoind class of hypotheses woudl be that somehow such advice "bubbles up" from ancestral microworlds through the control structure of the mind.  (I believe the specific  is explainable as one wherein the MPOLY world accepted advice of an ancestral world of number knowledge: "When investigating big numbers, try incremnets of ten".)  A third class of hypotheses would be that somehow connections are established between knowledge microworlds within clusters -- i.e. that very local kinds of knowledge aboiut knowledge develop.  I believe this latter happens only rarely but is most significant, for the process (the correspondence of perspectives as described in The Progressive Construction of Mind) generates those kinds of knowledge which may later appear as abstract, problem-solving knowledge, i.e. the last is ultimate a hope for explaining the genesis of the first, the appearance of the problem-solving homuncukus in the mind.




^^^^^^^^^^What knowledge of this did Miriam own early in The Intimate Study^?  The material presented [*in section 10] showed her developing sensitivity to the angles 90 and 180 degrees.  In contrast, the previous subsection showed Miriam preferring angles such as 116, 80, 160, and146 to those we recognize as generating the simplest closed polygons.  Thus, this distinction of which angles are interesting clearly marks a discrimination between two worlds of thought.  In her exposure to SHOOT, angle was first required, and more or less easy to perceive, where the appropriateness of a distance quantity could only be judged after the angle was nearly ocrrect.  In her use of MPOLY, distance faded to insignificance.  Miriam noted how a PLYSPI of 60 degrees was similar to those of 58and 59 degrees, though lacking the "curly things", but she did not appreciate, perhaps did not even suspect, that there might be some close relationship between the regularity of the hexagonal maze and the six armed spiral emerging from the figure with an interated turing of 59 degrees.  There is no indication at all that Miriam comprehended the iteration-connection of these worlds of thought ab initio.

Because Turtle Geometry exhibits a seminal idea (the design of knowledge environments specifically for children as a central endeavor of education) and because its realization in the Logo programming language is the nexus of what the Logo project has to show for the labors of its erly years, many activities which are commonly described as Turtle Geometry will not appear in this place.  Here we focus on descriptions of space and simple navigations in space through those descriptions.

  Material presented later argues we should describe this difference as one between two clusters of microworlds.  Let us name them the DESIGN and the NAVIGATION clusters.  We know that the DESIGN cluster is strongly related at the surface to the NAVIGATION cluster -- the self-same medium of computer displays and common names for important elements, e.g. "angle",are enough to guarantee that.  Thus,  this social contract of nomenclature should be enough for a person to assign these microworlds to a single, putative microworld cluster.  But

  [*This observation marks a central theme of this paper].  THE GUIDANCE provided in cognitive development by the polysemantic vocabulary of the language.  This guidance is a linguistic artifact provided within and by the culture regardless of didactic intent or its absence.  Having a POLYSEMANTIC VOCABULARY means that many words have multiple senses.  The common nomenclature in different applications of a word is a persistent cultural influence for unifying disparate structures developed from diverse experiences.  The use of the same label "angle" as an operand for an operation, e.g. RIGHT :ANGLE, and as a variable name input to a procedure which controls execution of that operation upon different values of that variable is a clue to the central problem of learning/  Natural language does not mark the elevation of control, despite its being a pervasive phenomenon of human mentality; therefore, the disambiguation of nomenclature across levels of control is an essential construct by each individual.
