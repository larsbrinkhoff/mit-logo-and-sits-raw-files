Turtle Geometry I     second draft

The major element of the Turtle Geometry I will be a set of " Projects Booklets."  They will
be supported by a set of reference materials, which might all be in one booklet, on cards,
in separate booklets, etc.  A general preface to the reference materials will explain
how they can be used with the Projects Booklets.  I now see the following general outline
for user oriented materials:

Part			What it Does
   
the Keyboard            You type commands at the keyboard to tell the
                        computer what to do.

The TV Screen           The TV Screen shows the things you type, and many
                        of the things you tell the computer to do.      

the Computer            The computer changes the instructions you type
                        at the keyboard into electronic signals, and carries
                        out your commands.

the Cassette            The cassette recorder stores your computer
  recorder              programs on magnetic cassette tapes.

LOGO                    LOGO is a computer language--a complicated 
                        computer program which changes your words into
                        electronic signals for the computer.

The Turtle              The Turtle is a computer controlled electronic
                        robot which appears on your TV screen.  It responds     
                        to LOGO commands which you type on the Keyboard.
                        The Turtle can move, turn and draw lines on the TV
                        screen.

The Turtle's Pen        The Turtle uses its pen to draw lines on the TV
                        Screen.

The Turtles Head        The Turtle's Head shows the direction in which
                        the Turtle will move if you command it to go
                        forward.
.endtable

Some other parts of your LOGO system have not yet been invented.

.table
Procedures              Procedures are new commands that you teach the
                        computer by giving a name to a series of LOGO
                        commands.  When you type the procedure's name, the
                        computer carries out the entire series of commands.
                        In this way you can make the Turtle perform very
                        complicated actions.


Messages                Messages are pieces of information that you store
                        by giving a name to a box inside the computer
                        in which the message will be kept until you need it.
                        When you type the box's name, the computer will
                        send you the message, change the message, or use it in
                        a procedure.

II - Using the computer keyboard (Keyboard diagram here?)

     A computer keyboard is someting like an electric typewriter.
When you type on the keyboard, the characters that you type will
appear on the TV Screen.  The small rectangle that appears on the
screen is called a cursor.  The cursor shows you where the next
character will be typed.  The cursor moves one position every time you
type a character.  Special keys allow you to send a command to the
computer; to stop the computer's action; to move the cursor around so
that you can type in a different place on the screen;   
or to rub out something you have already typed.  Here are some of the
special keys on your keyboard.

.table
Purpose             Key-Label     What It Does

"do-it"                 enter           This key sends a command to the
                                        computer.  Type the do-it key when 
                                        you have finished typing a COMMAND
                                        and you want the computer to "do it."
                                        On some keyboards the do-it key is 
                                        labeled "enter" or "return."

space                   long bar        The space bar leaves a space when 
                                        you type.

shift                   shift           This allows you to do special
                                        things on the keyboard, or to
                                        type extra characters with each
                                        key.  Hold the shift key down
                                        while you type
                                        another key at the same time.

rubout                  shift-U         This rubs out the last character that you typed.

stop                    shift-G         This makes the computer stop whatever it is
                                        doing and wait for your next command.

cursor-up               shift-XX        This moves the cursor up one line.

cursor-down             shift-XX        This moves the cursor down one line.

cursor-right            shift-XX        This moves the cursor to the right.

cursor-left             shift-XX        This moves the cursor one space to the left.

III - Things That The Turtle Can Do

.block 9
     The turtle is very good at drawing pictures.  By commanding the turtle to move
forward and back, and to turn to its own right and left, you can make it draw pictures
on the TV screen.  Here are the simplest things the Turtle can do:
.sp 6
.table
FORWARD 100             This commands the turtle to move forward 100 
                        turtle steps.  With its pen down, 
                        it draws a line as it moves.
.sp 6

.endtable
.block 7
RIGHT 100               This time the turtle turns to its own right
                        l00 degrees.
.sp 6

.block 8
PENUP                   This tells the turtle to lift its pen up.  The pen will 
                        stay up until you type PENDOWN.
                

.sp 6


.block 7
FORWARD 100             Now the turtle moves forward 100 Turtle steps
                        without drawing a line.
.sp 6

.adjust
Using combinations of simple Turtle commands, you can make the Turtle draw 
simple shapes;


or put them together into more complicated drawings;


or make exciting geometric designs;


or draw stick figures and cartoons.
.page 
IV - Getting Started in Turtle Talk

A.  Controlling the Turtle

    FORWARD and BACK are commands which make the Turtle move, and RIGHT and LEFT make 
the Turtle turn.  FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT and LEFT need inputs: numbers which tell the 
Turtle how far to move or how many degrees to turn.  You can type like this:
.nofill 

        FD 100  
        RT 45
        BK 70
        LT 45

.adjust
     Be sure to type a space between the command and its input number, or the computer
will be confused.  When you are ready to tell the computer to carry out a command, type
the do-it key.

     These Turtle commands do not need inputs.  Just type the command and the do-it key.

.nofill

CS      This clears the Turtle's screen and returns the Turtle to the center
        of its screen.

PU      This lifts the Turtle's pen up, so that it won't draw when it moves
        forward or back.

PD      This puts the Turtle's pen down so that it will draw.

.adjust
Things to try:
    Experiment with the Turtle.  Type FD, BK, RT and LT, with a lot of different
inputs.  Here are some more suggestions of things to do with the Turtle:

.ss
Make the Turtle draw a square.  Or a rectangle.  Or a triangle.

Make an unplanned drawing using a variety of Turtle commands. 

Find the size of the Turtle's screen.

Pick a point on the screen and move the Turtle there. 

.ds
Errors to try.  Tyype these "commands" and see what happens:
.nofill
FD100
FD

FD L00

Type your name, or ask the computer a question.

.adjust
Page XXX of the Introductory Turtle Geometry Project Booklet has many more ideas of 
things you can do with the turtle.

Debugging - What happens if the computer gets confused?

When the computer can't understand what you want it to do,
it sends you an error message.  This is the computer's way
of telling you why it couldn't do what you wanted.  Many
error messages are caused by typing errors (like forgetting
a space and typing FD100 instead of FD 100).  Everyone who
uses a computer makes mistakes like this.  The computer
doesn't care if you make mistakes.  It just prints an error
message and waits for you to type another command.  An
error in a computer procedure or command is called a bug.
Correcting errors is called debugging.  You will learn a lot about bugs and 
debugging as you use the computer.  For information about the most common bugs, and for
ideas about debugging, you can read the DEBUGGING book.  This book may help you if you
get stuck while using the computer.

.block 5
B.  You can teach the computer to remember how to draw a particular design without
typing in all the steps each time.  This is called defining a procedure.  The name
of the procedure you define will become a new LOGO word that is part of your own
private LOGO vocabulary.

.block 8
Here is an example, which you can copy if you want to:
.nofill
TO  FUNNYTHING
FD 100
RT 120
FD 45
LT 35
BK 75
END

After you type END, the computer will print
.block 5
FUNNYTHING DEFINED
.adjust
Now, every time you give the command FUNNYTHING, the computer will carry out the
procedure you have defined.

Things to try:
Copy FUNNYTHING, or make up your own procedure with a different name.  Once you have
taught the computer a new procedure, type its name several times to see what happens.

Teach the computer to draw a square or triangle. Repeat that procedure several times.

There are now many different things you can teach the computer.  You will find ideas
on pages xx to xx of the Introductory Turtle Geometry Projects Booklet.

Debugging: If you have problems teaching new commands to the computer, you may find pages
xx to xx of the DEBUGGING booklet helpful.
        
.block 5
C.  Editing a LOGO Procedure

There are several reasons why you might want to change a LOGO procedure:

.indent 2
.undent 2
- You might have made a typing error, so that the computer doesn't understand
what you typed;

.undent 2
- You might have left out a command, or typed in a wrong command, so that the 
computer does not do what you intended;

.undent 2
- The computer might do exactly what you intended, but you would now like the 
procedure to behave differently.

.indent 0
Suppose you want to make a change in the procedure, FUNNYTHING.

Type    TO FUNNYTHING  (do-it)

just as you did when you taught FUNNYTHING to the computer for the first time.  The
computer will respond by printing:

YOU HAVE ALREADY TOLD ME HOW TO FUNNYTHING. DO YOU WANT TO EDIT IT?

If you type Y<do-it>  (meaning "yes") the computer will print out the procedure, and wait
for you to make any changes you might want to make.  If you type anything else, the computer
will simply wait for another command.

If you type Y <do-it>, the computer will print out the procedure with the steps numbered:

.nofill
.block 6
TO FUNNYTHING
1 FORWARD 100
2 RIGHT 120
3 FORWARD 45
4 LEFT 35
5 BACK 75

.adjust
The cursor will appear at the top left of the procedure.  You can use special keys to move
the cursor to the line you want to change.

Changing a line of a procedure:
To change line 3 from FORWARD 45 to FORWARD 35 (for example), use the cursor-down key
(shift-xx) to move the cursor to line 3.  Then use the cursor-right key (shift-xx)
to move the cursor to the end of the line:
.nofill
3 FORWARD 45
Use the rubout key (shift-xx) twice to erase the 45:
3 FORWARD
You can now type 35:
3 FORWARD 35
If this is the last change you want to make, type (shift-xx) 
and the computer will print
FUNNYTHING DEFINED.

(similar sections will be added when we know more about how 
the editing keys function)

Rubbing out a line of a procedure
Adding a new line to a procedure
Changing a procedure's name
Etc.

.block 5
V - More Turtle Talk

A. Procedures that draw circles and arcs.
         Special procedures, RCIRCLE, LCIRCLE, RARC and LARC make the turtle draw
circles and arcs.  Like FORWARD and RIGHT, each circle and arc command needs an input.

.tabfnt 0
.nofill
RCIRCLE 20      Makes the Turtle draw a circle of radius 20, curving
                to the right.

LCIRCLE 20      Makes the Turtle draw a circle of radius 20, curving
                to the left.

RARC 50         Makes the Turtle draw a quarter-circle of radius 50, curving
                to the right.

LARC 50         Makes the Turtle draw a quarter-circle of radius 50, curving 
                to the left.

.adjust
Pages ----- of the Introductory Turtle Geometry Projects Booklet show many
 projects that can be carried out using circle and arc procedures. 

.nofill
B. Some special Turtle tricks
     1.  Making the Turtle "invisible"

.nofill
The LOGO command HT (abbreviation for HIDETURTLE) makes the Turtle's image
 disappear from the screen.  To see the Turtle again, type ST (SHOWTURTLE).

Example:
.block 5
.sp 4
.spread
/SQUARE/HT/ST

     2.  Making the Turtle "wrap around the screen."

.adjust
The LOGO command WRAP makes it possible for the Turtle to go off one edge
of the screen, and come back in on the reverse side, just as though its path
had been "wrapped" around the screen.  NOWRAP prevents the Turtle from
wrapping around the screen.
Example:
.block 7
.sp 4
.spread
/FORWARD 100/WRAP/FORWARD 100/OUT OF BOUNDS

C. Moving the Turtle directly to a point:
     l.  The command HOME sends the Turtle directly back to the center of the screen:
.block 6
.sp 3
.nofill
                HOME                    PENUP HOME
.adjust
.block 12
     2.  The Turtle can be moved directly to any other point on the screen using
the command SETXY.  SETXY needs two inputs--the x and y coordinates of the point
to which the Turtle is to move:

.spread
/CLEARSCREEN/SETXY 100 50/SETXY 100 (-50)

.spread
/SETXY -100 0/SETXY 0 (-100)/HOME


SETXY does not change the direction in which the Turtle is heading.  If the second input
to SETXY is negative, it must be enclosed in parentheses.  Try typing SETXY 100 -50.
Then type SETXY 100 (-50).  Try a lot of different inputs to SETXY.
.nofill
     3.  SETHEADING can set the direction in which the Turtle is heading without
changing its position, and without using RIGHT or LEFT.  SETHEADING needs one input -
the angle in which the Turtle is to be heading.
Examples:



CLEARSCREEN             SETHEADING 45           SETHEADING 180


SETHEADING 300          SETHEADING 360          SETHEADING -90

.adjust
An interesting fact about SETHEADING is that the same effect can be obtained with
different inputs.  For example, SETHEADING 0 has the same effect as SETHEADING 360;
SETHEADING 270 has the same effect as SETHEADING-90.

Try lots of Inputs to SETHEADING.

     4.  XCOR, YCOR, HEADING and HERE are LOGO commands which make the computer
output a message.
XCOR makes the computer output the Turtle's x coordinate.  YCOR makes the computer
output the Turtle's y coordinate.
HEADING makes the computer output the Turtle's direction.
HERE makes the computer output a list of all three numbers that give the Turtle's state:
its x and y coordinates and its heading.

Things to try:
Move the Turtle somewhere on the screen.  Then type:

PRINT XCOR, PRINT YCOR, PRINT HEADING, PRINT HERE

Since XCOR, YCOR and HEADING output numbers are messages, they can be used as inputs
to something else.
FORWARD XCOR will move the Turtle forward a distance equal to its current x coordinate.

.block 9
.nofill
Type these commands:

SETXY XCOR 100
SETXY XCOR 50
SEXTXY XCOR+10  100
SETXY XCOR YCOR
SETXY XCOR +YCOR  100
SETHEADING HEADING + 90
etc.

.adjust
     5. Naming a point
         You can give a name to a point on the TV screen, and use the command
SETTURTLE (abbreviated SETT) to move the Turtle directly to the point at a later time.

One way to name a point is to tell the computer a list of three numbers for the x, y
and heading coordinates of the point:

CALL [100 50 90] "Point1

The command CALL makes the computer store the message  100 50 90 in a "box" named
"POINT1. SETT :POINT1 tells the computer to use the message stored in the box 
named "POINT1 as input to the command SETTURTLE.

Another way to name a point is to move the Turtle to a particular point first.  When
the Turtle is at the point you want to name, type:
.nofill
CALL HERE "POINT2
.adjust
This makes the computer store the list of three numbers output by the command HERE,
in a "box" whose name is "POINT2.  If you type SETT :POINT2, the computer will use the
message stored in the box named "POINT2 as input to the command SETTURTLE.

Things to try:
Use both methods of naming points to name a lot of points on your screen.  Use
SETTURTLE to move the Turtle around to the different points.

.block 5
VI - Using the REPEAT command

The LOGO command REPEAT tells the computer to repeat a command or a list of commands, a
specified number of times.
REPEAT needs two inputs.  The first is a list of commands that the computer is to 
repeat.  The second is the number of repeats.
Examples:
.block 8
.sp 4
.nofill
TO SQUARE                               TO STAR
REPEAT [FD 100 RT 90]   4               REPEAT [SQUARE RT 60]   6
END                                     END
.adjust
The first input to REPEAT must be enclosed in brackets   .  It may contain as many commands
as you like.

Things to Try:
Pages xxxxx of the Introductory Turtle Geometry Projects Booklet shows some
Turtle designs that can be drawn using REPEAT.

.block 5
VII - More About Using Procedures
A. Using Subprocedures as "building blocks."

Once you have taught the computer a new command, that command becomes part of the computer's
vocabulary.  It can be used as a subprocedure when you teach the computer another command.

For example, a girl named Kathy taught the computer to draw a box:
.page
.nofill
TO BOX
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 100
END

.ri 
BOX

Kathy used BOX as a subprocedure to make this design.

She also used BOX to make these designs:

TO TRIANGLE
LEFT 90
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 120

By combining her BOX and TRIANGLE procedures she made the Turtle draw a HOUSE:
.block 6
.sp 4

HOUSE

She then used HOUSE to create another simple design:

Things to Try:
Pages xxxx of the Introductory Turtle Geometry Projects Booklet will give you
some ideas of designs that can be built using subprocedures as "building blocks."

B. Using Subprocedures and Superprocedures in Planning
     If you plan to have the computer carry out a complex project such as drawing
a face, it is useful to make a plan for the project in advance.  Try to anticipate all the
parts you will need, and make each part a subprocedure.  Then you can write a 
superprocedure to draw the entire project.  After teaching the computer the superprocedure,
you can teach it each subprocedure one by one.

Examples:
Suppose you want the computer to draw this rocket:  You might divide the project into four
parts:

.nofill
.block 6
TO ROCKET
CONE
BODY
LEFTFIN
RIGHTFIN
.spread
/CONE/BODY/LEFTFIN/RIGHTFIN

.adjust
When you teach each part to the computer separately, you might fnd that you need
additional commands to locate each part of the rocket in the right place.  You
might eventually change your rocket proceedure:

.nofill
.block 9
TO ROCKET
SETCONE
CONE
SETBODY
BODY
SETLEFTFIN
LEFTFIN
SETRIGHTFIN
RIGHTFIN

.adjust
In this superproceedure, SETCONE moves the turtle to the right location to draw the
cone. Setbody moves the turtle to the right location to draw the body, etc.

Here are some other examples:
Kevin made the computer draw a "turtle" using four subprocedures:

                        TURTLE

.adjust
Since the "Turtle" has four feet, the subprocedure FOOT was used four times in
Kevin's superprocedure, TURTLE.
This CLOCK used seven subprocedures:
OUTSIDE, MINUTEHAND, HOURHAND, TWELVE, THREE, SIX and NINE.

CLOCK

Donald drew a complicated HEAD, using a superprocedure and many subprocedures:

.nofill
.block 10
TO HEAD
BOX
EYES
NOSE
MOUTH
BEARD
HAIR
EARS
HAT
FLOWER

.adjust
Some of these subprocedures also had subprocedures of their own.  BEARD had a
subprocedure called STRING; HAIR had a subprocedure called HAIRY; EARS had a
subprocedure, EAR; HAT had a subprocedure LBOX; and FLOWER had a subprocedure,
POLY.

Things to try:
Make your own plan for a complicated LOGO project.  Figure out all the parts you'll
need and write a superprocedure.  Then write each of the subprocedures.


Pages xxxx of the Introductory Turtle Geometry Projects Booklet have many more
suggestions of projects you can make using subprocedures in planning.

C. Using a Procedure "Tree"
     A "procedure tree" is a list that you can make showing all the subprocedures
in a project, and showing which procedures "control" each subprocedure.  A
procedure tree can be a useful way to think about a project while you are working on it, or
when you are trying to explain it to someone.
Examples:
Kathy's procedure HOUSE, used BOX and TRIANGLE as subprocedures.  The procedure
tree for HOUSE looks like this:

     BOX      TRIANGLE                  
                                HOUSE

Things to try:
Take one of your own projects.  List all the subprocedures.  Then draw a procedure
tree for the project.
