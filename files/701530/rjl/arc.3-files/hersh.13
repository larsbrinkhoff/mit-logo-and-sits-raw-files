	The numbers to the right of the articles are the prices you were
asking for each item, the $453 total is the total of the asking prices
for the items we want, and the $400 figure is the price we agreed on
for the whole lot.
	We didn't discuss when you want to be paid the $400. We could
pay you at the closing, the day (Sunday August 29th) before the closing,
or before then if you would like. If you want to be paid now just let me
know. My number at home is 731-4831; at work, 253-3473.
