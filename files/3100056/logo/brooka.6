LOGO AT THE LINCOLN SCHOOL

GENERAL PREFACE

September 1979 will begin the fourth year of a highly productive
relationship between the M.I.T. LOGO group and the Lincoln School
in Brookline, Mass. This report presents a particular slice of what
has been learned from the experience - the slice that we think is
likely to be most relevant to teachers and administrators with enough
foresight to be interested in what schools will be able to do with the
next generation of personal computers, that is to say those that
can be expected to become the dominant species of school computer in
the first few years of the decade of th nineteen eighties. This is
not very far away. By 1982 a BASIC speaking TRS-80 with virtually
no graphics will seem as obsolete as the time shared computers which
are now so rapidly being displaced by the little micros.  And 1980
is hardly too soon for schools which take themselves seriously to
be thinkng about what they will be doing in 1982.

A very important part of the work at the Lincoln School was carried
out under a grant from the NSF program for research in science
education. In fact, Parts II and III of this report constitute the
final technical report to the NSF on what was done with that grant.
They describe the learning experience of sixteen sixth grade students
who learned LOGO during the school year 1977/8 under conditions
designed to allow us to collect and analyse an unusually large 
body of data about their progress.

Part II presents systematic analyses of
this data from a number of points of view that will be of interest to
educators. It definbes a set of programming concepts and skills that
it then demoinstartes to be within the reach of most sixth grade
students. It offers eviednce in support of a conjecture about  what
modifications of method would allow
even those students who did not achive our criteria for "learning
to program"  to do so. It goes on to show how learning to program
can enhancee learning other, more traditional subjects. It focusses
special attention on "excpetional students" at bothe ends of the
spectrum of school performance. Finally, it shows how programmimng un
LOGO bears of the important problem of bringning out and enhancing 
individual cognitive styles.

Part III gives the report a dimension of concreteness and specificity
that is often missing when the identity of the individual students
in an educatiobnal experiemnt  disappears into summative statistics.
To prevent this we asked the teacher to write a report on each student
that is perosnal in two ways: it discusses each student as an individual,
presenting a profile of her/his intellectual perosnality and her/his learning
experience as seen from the personal perspective of a teacher who had
the opoortunity to get to know the studnts particularly well.

These two Parts of the report are being made available at this time
because we owe them to the NSF.  Part I, which will not be ready until
Fall, provides  readers who do not know our work with a conteext for the
research reported in Parts II and III by discussing  LOGO's
educational and  computation-theoretic perspectives.

The future of Part IV is more precarious.  The work with the sixteen
sixth grade students was the beginning of something much bigger. The
most satisfying mark of success is the fcat that the Brookline School
system used its own funds to allow LOGO's presence at Lincoln to continue
after the NSF grant ended. Thus there has been a further year of LOGO and
e have plans for more of them.  If we have the ressources to do so we
shall be ading a Part IV bearing on these further developments. This
document will, if it comes into being, act as a more concrete guide
to schools who wish to emuklate the kind of work we report here.
