The LOGO command KEYTURTLE (abbrev. KT) switches the computer into
Keyturtle mode.  In this mode, turtles can be moved directly by
typing in commands at the keyboard.  KEYTURTLE mode is used to design
both tile patterns and Tortoise shells.

Tile patterns can appear in two colors, a background color and a
foreground color.  If you want the pattern to appear in red against a
black background, type
COLORS [RED  BLACK]

In the appendix on p.   , you will find a list of all possible color
combinations for tile patterns.

In the bottom left square of the grid you will find the turtle.  The
following LOGO commands can now be used to design the tile pattern:

FORWARDDOTSPOTS (abbrev. FDD)
BACKDOTSPOTS (abbrev. BKD)
RIGHTTURN (abbrev. RT)
LEFTTURN (abbrev. LT)
PENUP (abbrev. PU)
PENDOWN (abbrev. PD)
ERASERUP (abbrev. EU)
ERASERDOWN (abbrev. ED) [If this abbrev. holds, EDIT will not be abbreviated] 

We want to dsign a tile pattern that will look like this:


















To do this, we can use the following sequence of commands:

PU
FDD 3
PD
RT 90
FDD 8
LT 90
FDD l
LT 90
FDD 7
PU
FDD 3
RT 90
FDD 3
PD
RT 90
FDD 8
LT 90
FDD l
LT 90
FDD 7

[Seems that you have to do too much for too little.  Maybe it's better
just to use arrow-keys...] 

Notice that as you design the tile pattern, the pattern appears in
actual size, step-by-step, alongside the grid.

If you give the turtle a command that causes it to draw something you
don't like, you can erase that portion using the command ERASERDOWN.

If, for example, we had forgotten to type PU at the beginning and then
typed FDD 3, we would get

.sp 8

To erase the shadded portion you could type:
ED
BKD 3
EU
ERASERDOWN replaces the foreground color with the background color.

Now that we have designed our border tile pattern, we type
