Acknowledgments

This project has been a collaboration between a Public School system in
Brookline, Massachusetts and a University Research Team, the MIT LOGO
Group.  Without the full participation of a large number of people from
both institutions, the Lincoln School LOGO Project could never have
occurred.  From the Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Robert I. Sperber,
to the principal of Lincoln School, Gerry Cote, to the sixth grade
teachers, Lisa Hirsh, Bob Lewis and Florence Regolino who
enthusiastically supported the project and attended to the sixth grade
students who were its most immediate beneficiaries, the involvement of
students and staff of the Brookline school system was an essential
ingredient of the project.

Trial classes at Lincoln School were taught by Dr. Dan Watt, a
Brookline teacher whose services were subcontracted to the project on a
full-time basis.  Dan Watt also had primary responsibility for
collecting data about each child's progress and coordinating all the
activities at the school.

The trial classes were planned and materials for them were developed by
members of the LOGO Group, Professors Seymour Papert, Harold Abelson,
Andy diSessa and Jeanne Bamberger.  The data collection and analysis
activities of the LOGO Group were coordinated by Dr. Sylvia Weir.
These members of the LOGO Group also participated in the ongoing
observation of the trial classes, revision of activities and in an
ongoing series of project meetings which monitored the progress of the
classes.  MIT students Ellen Hildreth and Ursula Wolz also observed
trial classes and collected data and participated in project meetings.

Our approach to data collection and analysis was developed over many
years as an integral part of the research work of the  Laboratory.
The use of dribble files was initiated by Cynthia Solomon. The tradition
of detailed class commentaries was developed by Solomon,Gerianne Goldstein
and Kiyoko Okumura.  The plan for this study was developed
by the project staff in  
consultation with Professor George E. Hein and Ms. Stephanie (Penny)
Dunning of the Program Evaluation and Research Group of Lesley College,
who also assisted us in developing the pre/post interviews used with
our experimental subjects.  Penny Dunning also conducted the pre/post
interviews, and observed the classes at regular intervals.  George Hein
conducted classroom observations, interviewed the students' classroom
teachers after each round of experimental classes, and participated in
several project meetings.

An important aspect of the project was the way in which the computer
culture was able to spread within the school.  In addition to the
experimental classes for our sixteen subjects LOGO classes were also
provided for the rest of the sixth graders in the school.  These
classes were taught by volunteers, mostly MIT students, who were
supervised by Dan Watt, and Professors Abelson, diSessa and Bamberger.
The volunteer teachers who contributed greatly to the overall success
of the project were: Harvey Alcabes, Enno Becker, Kou-Mei Chuang, John
Hengeveld, Danny Hillis, Rene Margulies, Margaret Minsky, Brian
Schwartz, and Ursula Wolz.  An after school computer club, led by MIT
graduate student Jose Valente provided an opportunity for seventh and
eighth grade students to learn LOGO, and for certain sixth graders to
extend and deepen their LOGO knowledge.In addition to teaching, these students
contributed beyond measure to the intellectual atmosphere surrounding
the project. Since it was in the nature of this project to be
"conservative" in developing a version of LOGO that could be integrated into
schools in an immediate horizon and in the nature of these students to be
be "revolutionary" in looking beyond such immediate horizons, many
of the student generated ideas have not found a place in this report.They
will make themselves increasingly felt in future research directions.

The project's technical components including hardware and
software support were carried out  by Ron Lebel and Brian Silverman.

Data analysis was carried out by the entire project staff.  Our 
analysis owes a great deal to discussions with Professors
Hermine Sinclair-de Zwaart of the University of Geneva and Guy
Groen of McGill University, both of whom visited classes, attended
project meetings, and commented critically on our first attempts at analysis.

We had a number of visitors to our experimental classes, many of
whom made important comments.  Two visitors whose
insights were especially pertinent were Cynthia Solomon and Kyoko Okumura-
Montpetit, both highly experienced LOGO teachers and innovators.
Cynthia Solomon conducted a follow-up study in the school during
the subsequent (i.e. the current) school year whose results 
will be published in due course. Another kind of insight was
contributed by Susan Hartnett who attended a number of classes and
filmed one as part of an experiment in the use of film to capture
aspects of the children's work.  Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the
project was its inability, imposed by lack of resources, to follow
up on new insights contributed by visitors. However, many of them have
been absorbed into future oriented thinking.

Behind the scenes at all times was Gregory Gargarian who is listed in
official papers as "secretary" but who in fact did enormously more than
can properly be described by that (or perhaps any other)) term.
In addition to orchestrating a complex, movement of machines, people and texts
so that the right ones would be in the right places at the right times he
was the person who was most in touch with the day to day needs of the
project and of the people in it.

An Interim Report,
describing the work of the first eight students, and containing our
first attempt at data analysis, was written by the entire project
staff, and coordinated by Sylvia Weir.  This report was published  as
LOGO Memo #49 in the spring of l978.

This final project report was written by Prof. Seymour Papert, Dan Watt,
Andy diSessa and Sylvia Weir, under the overall direction of Prof. Papert.
The appendix containing individual student profiles was written by
Dan Watt.
