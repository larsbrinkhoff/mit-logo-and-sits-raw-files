INTRODUCTION TO TURTLE GRAPHICS AND PROCEDURE WRITING

COMMANDS

FD.  Forward.  This command requires an input* of a number,
e.g. FD 100.  This command will cause the turtle to move in
the direction of its heading* the specified number of turtle
units.  See what happens if the command is typed
without an input.  Note that the turtle* does not move and	
the error message* "FORWARD NEEDS MORE INPUTS" appears on
the screen.  
BK.  Back.  This command also requires an input of a number,
e.g. BK 100.  This command will cause the turtle to move
away from the direction of its heading the specified number
of turtle units.  
RT.  Right.  This command requires an input of a number,
e.g. RT 90.  The input corresponds to the degree measure of
the angle the turtle is to turn.  Remember that "right"
means that the turtle will turn right the specified number
of degree relative to a given heading.
LT.  Left.  This command requires an input of a number, e.g.
LT 90.  The command operates jusyt like the command "RT"
except that the turtle turns left relative to its heading.
PU.  Pen up.  This command allows you to move the turtle
without indicating a line on the screen.
PD.  Pen down.  This command causes the turtle to resume its
practice of drawing lines on the screen as it moves about.
ST.  Show turtle.  This command causes the turtle to be
visible on the screen.  The turtle is representred in the
form of an arrow point and is pointing in the direction of
its heading.
HT.  Hide turtle.  This command causes the turtle to be
invisible on the screen.	
CS.  Clear screen.  This command clears the screen. 
WRAP.  Wrap.  This command permits you to give large inputs
to the FD and BK commands without generating the "OUT OF
BOUNDS" error message (see (3) below).  Instead, LOGO will
"wrap" the out of bounds portion ofits trip back onto the screen.
SOME COMMON BUGS

(1) If you forget to specify an input to FD, BK, RT or LT,
LOGO will generate an error message, as explaiuned in the
definition of "FD" above.
(2) If you forget to leave a space between any of the above
commands and the number given as input,e.g. you type
"FD100",  LOGO will generate the error message "YOU HAVEN'T
 TOLD ME HOW TO FD100".  What has happened is that LOGO has
read the LOGO word* "FD100" as a would-be user-defined
procedure.
(3)If you give FD or BK an input that would take the turtle
off the screen, LOGO will generate the error message "OUT OF
BOUNDS".  You can prevent this by using the LOGO command
"WRAP".

TERMINAL SESSION

This terminal session* will introduce you to the basics of
turtle* graphics and procedure* writing.  The object of the
session will be to get LOGO* to draw a simple house [figure
here] and to teach LOGO the procedure HOUSE.  Typical bugs*
are included in the session to give you an idea of what is
likely to arise when you  make drawings and define
procedures on your own.  "Big ideas"* relevant to solving the
problem will also be introduced, so that you will acquire
some ideas of the style of procedure writing since these
ideas are ideas that are typically useful in planning and
executing such projects.
				
Type LOGIN.  When the question mark (?) appears on the
screen, LOGO is ready to receive a command.  Right at the	
outset you have a choice.        You can either set out to trace
out the unsubdivided house figure as shown above (this is
typically how children first draw such figures) or you can
use the "big idea" of "Divide and Conquer" and break the
problem down to one of drawing a square and a triangle and
then figure out how to brig them together to draw a house.
While the first method is fine as a beginning approach
(children often make quite elaborate drawings using it), we
will follow out the second since it will serve us as a
paradigm for using subprocedures when, at the end of this
session, we discuss how to write a program* we shall call
HOUSE to draw the figure shwon above.

First, let's draw a square.  So that we are able to follow
the turtle as it draws our figure, first get it to appear on
the screeen.  To do this, type ST.  Note that when the
turtle first appears, it is situated in the middle of the
screen, pointing upwards.  It should be easy to see that the
following steps should give us a square with sides of 100
turtle units length:

     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100

Now, let's draw a triangle.  You might like to experiment on	
your own first by covering the following steps:

     ?FD 100
     ?RT 120
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 120
     ?FD 100

Did you mistakenly give RT an input of 60?  Remember that
you have to tell LOGO the number of degrees that the turtle
has to move, not how many degrees that the angle to be drawn
will measure.

We now have a squqre and a triangle.  If you just type in
the commands as listed above the turtle will draw, not a
house, but the following.  This is a bug* which needs now to
be analyzed and corrected ("debugged").  There are a number
of solutions that may occur to you.  The following is only
one.

If we first reorder the steps to make a square, thus:

     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100

Note that this approach has the advantage of leaving the
turtle facing in the same dire4ction as i8t was when we
started.  If now we add the steps for the triangle, the
turtle will draw this*		
[figure]





Clearly, it is necessary to make the turtle change direction
before advancing another 100 steps.  With a little
experimentation, you should arrive at the following list of
commands for the house figure we set out to draw:

     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 90
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 120
     ?FD 100
     ?RT 120
     ?FD 100

It would be a good idea to return the turtle to its original
heading.  Can you figure out which comand with what input
will accomplish this?

TO HOUSE--WRITING A PROGRAM

COMMANDS

TO.  This command followed by a LOGO word causes LOGO to
enter the procedure-writing mode*.
END.  This command tells LOGO that a procedure has been defined.  

If you wanted to draw the particular house shown in figure
___ or to use this house in a composite figure or drawing
you could, of course, just include the above steps each
time.  This , however, would entail a tremendous expenditure
of time.  What you can do is to write a program that
includes the above steps, allowing you to produce the house
figure on the screen merely by typing HOUSE (or whatever
name you choose to call the program--just so slong as there
is no LOGO command or previously defined procedure by this
name).  

Type the word TO followed by the name you have chosen to
give the program, say, CASA.  LOGO is now in
procedure-writing mode [?].  

You could now type in all the steps, type "END" at the end
and, wiothout further ado, have a program "TO CASA" which
will cause the turtle to draw a house each time you type
"CASA".
Note that you should only type the procedure name--and NOT
the LOGO command "TO" when you want the program to be executed.

If you had wanted to, you could have labelled sections of
the program.  For example, you might have wanted to label
that part of the program that draws a square as "SQUARE:"
and that part of the program that draws a triangle as
"TRIANGLE:". Or you may have wished to label each line
separately.  Or you may have wished to do both. You can use
any LOGO word followed by a colon as a label.
