LOGO AT THE LINCOLN SCHOOL

.ce
GENERAL PREFACE

September 1979 will begin the fourth year of a highly productive
relationship between the M.I.T. LOGO group and the Lincoln School
in Brookline, Mass. This report presents a particular slice of what
has been learned from the experience - the slice that we think is
likely to be most relevant to teachers and administrators with enough
foresight to be interested in what schools will be able to do with the
next generation of personal computers -- those that
can be expected to become the dominant species of school computer in
the first few years of the 1980's.
This is
not very far away. By 1982 a "BASIC speaking" TRS-80 with virtually
no graphics will seem as obsolete as the time shared computers which
are now so rapidly being displaced by the little micros.  And 1980
is hardly too soon for schools 
to be thinking about what they will be doing in 1982.

An important part of the work at the Lincoln School was carried
out under a grant from the NSF program for Research in Science
Education.  Parts II and III of this report constitute the
final technical report to the NSF on what was done with that grant.
They describe the learning experience of sixteen sixth grade students
who learned LOGO during the school year 1977/8 under conditions
designed to allow us to collect and analyze an unusually large 
body of data about their progress.

Part II presents systematic analyses of
this data from a number of points of view that will be of interest to
educators. It defines a set of programming concepts and skills that
it then demonstrates to be within the reach of most sixth grade
students. By careful examination of data about the learning paths of  the
marginal students it develops conjectures about how the proportion of students
"proven to be capable of learning to program" could be further increased
in the environment defined by systems as flexible as LOGO. Moreover it	
shows how even with the existing techniques LOGO's flexibility allowed
students with the most severe learning problems to make significant gains
in directions other than learning to program.

The report presents a detailed analysis of the mathematical content
of an experience with a LOGO/turtle learning unit. It describes some
tests of transfer of learning gains into non-computational contexts.

The report also focuses 
special attention on "exceptional students" at both ends of the
spectrum of school performance. Finally, it shows how programming in
LOGO bears on the important problem of bringing out and enhancing 
individual cognitive styles.

Part III gives the report a dimension of concreteness and specificity
that is often missing when the identity of the individual students
in an educational experiment  disappears into summative statistics.
To prevent this we asked the teacher to write reports on each student.
These reports are personal in two senses:  they discuss each student individually,
presenting each student's intellectual personality and his or her learning
experience as seen from the personal perspective of a teacher who had
the opportunity to get to know the students particularly well.

These two parts of the report, promised to NSF at this time,  are now 
being made available.For general diffusion we shall add an introductory
Part I, which will be available early in the Fall, to
provide  readers, unfamiliar with  our work, with a context
for understanding the
research reported in Parts II and III. This will include a discussion of
LOGO's educational and  computation-theoretical perspectives and of other
related work of which there has been rather more in Europe and
in Quebec than in the United States.

The future of an intended Part IV is less certain.  The work with the sixteen
sixth grade students was the beginning of something bigger, the
spreading of LOGO culture in the schools. The
most satisfying mark of success is the fact that the Brookline School
system used its own funds to allow LOGO's presence at Lincoln to continue
after the NSF grant ended. 
If we have the resources to do so we
shall be adding a Part IV bearing on these further developments. This
document will, if it comes into being, act as a more concrete guide
to schools who wish to emulate the kind of work we report here.

11. Overview: Brookline LOGO Project

0This document  presents a large body of information about  what sixteen
sixth grade students made of a LOGO/turtle learning environment and how
we interpreted their
reactions to it.  We begin in this first chapter by presenting
in a general way the conclusions we have drawn from the
study. Each of the later chapters deals in greater detail 
with some aspect of the work. It should be read in conjunction with the
document called "PART III" which contains  the teacher's report
on each student.

.block 5
11. Participants

0The sixteen students were selected according to two criteria each of which
was intended to insure a variety of students including "average" 
and "exceptional" students at both ends of the spectrum of 
academic achievement. The first criterion was distribution on national achievement 
scores. Table 1 shows these scores for fifteen of the students.  The sixteenth
student, Karl, had not been tested with his classmates due to 
"severe learning disabilities". The second criterion was the judgment of the
classroom teachers who knew the students personally.  Teachers were
asked to rank them as below average, average, and above average.  Our
sample includes six students from each of the "non-average" groups.

1Adults in the Classroom

0The teacher involved in the study
had taught for seven years in the school and had been trained in
LOGO at M.I.T. during the year preceding the work with the students.  Before
joining the school staff he had participated in the E.D.C.  Elementary
Science Study (ESS) project. He was selected as someone who had
had experience as an elementary school teacher and who had been involved in 
the development of new educational materials.

Besides the teacher three kinds of observers were present from time to
time:
.br
.indent 3
.block 2
(1) regular professional observers
who were not members of the M.I.T. staff;
.br
.block 4
(2) occasional observers who were
not members of the M.I.T. project staff; 
.br
(3) members of the M.I.T. staff.

.indent 0
The following observers had the most significant impact on the project:

Prof. George Hein of Leslie College acting as consultant to E.D.C;
Ms. Penny Dunning acting as assistant to Prof. Hein.

Prof. Hermine Sinclair de Zwaart of the University of Geneva.

Prof. Guy Groen, McGill University, Faculty of Education;

Ms. Kiyoko Okumura-Montpetit of McGill University;

Ms. Cynthia Solomon from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

Professors Harold Abelson, Andrea diSessa, Seymour Papert, and Dr. Sylvia Weir, all
members of the M.I.T. LOGO Project.

Learning/Teaching Goals

12. Learning/Teaching Goals and Strategies

.block 5
12.1 The Classroom

0The classroom included four independent microcomputers,
each with its own keyboard, display screen and disc drive.  A printer was
available for use with one of the computers when necessary.  The
children were supplied with notebooks, graph paper, drawing paper,
different kinds of pens, pencils and markers, and a full set of
stationery supplies.  A small round table near a blackboard 
provided a setting for group lessons or discussions and
for informal conversation among the children.  Samples of the
children's work were displayed on bulletin boards around the room.

The children worked in  classes of four, so that there was always
a one-to-one ratio of students to computers. The length of the
class periods ranged from 40 to 90 minutes as a function of
the overall school schedule. Table 1.2 shows  the distribution of meetings.
We note in passing that we believe that the ratio of students
to computers is essential to the results we obtained and will be
typical of the computer-rich world of the near future. On the other
hand, we believe that the student/teacher ratio of 4/1 would not have been
necessary under more operational conditions.

2.2 Our Goals for the Students

0The LOGO system is designed to be flexible enough to serve as a
vehicle for many different patterns of learning.  Thus an important
part of the design of the project was making a set of decisions about
what we hoped the students would learn and what strategies the teacher
would adopt to bring this about. It was part of the strategy that while
the teacher would exert some pressure for the students to achieve the goals
we had set for them he would also allow deviations if he felt that a
particular student would not respond to the pre-determined goals. This
policy proved to be immensely valuable. Significant deviations took place
in two cases. In each of these the student taught us something
very profound about how a computer can be appropriated  to the service
of an individual's learning needs.  In one of the cases the student
eventually returned to the "standard goal"; in the other the deviant student
(Tina)had a learning experience of a totally different but extremely rich sort.
We shall return to the deviant students after discussing the goals we set up
in advance as the educational objectives of the classes. In presenting them
here we make an artificial separation of five "kinds" of learning. The reader
familiar with LOGO methods will understand that in fact these 
happen simultaneously as aspects of an organic whole . The students
do not perceive them as separate in the early stages of learning;
indeed, only those students who achieved a relatively high level of 
sophistication did so at all in the course of the study.

With these qualifications we can  describe the five general 
objectives as follows:

.block 3
.indent 6
1. Learning to feel comfortable with and in control of 
the computer.  Students learn that they can decide what
the computer will do: they teach the computer instructions for each of
their individually conceived projects.

.block 4
2. Learning the elements of the LOGO computer language.  This includes
.indent 8

.twinch 4.5
(A1) The idea of computer instruction in a formal language: its 
syntax, effect, and associated error messages; the LOGO commands
FORWARD, RIGHT etc. and the arithmetic operations.

(A2) The idea of sequential procedure and the ability to translate an
informally defined plan into a working program;the LOGO commands TO, END.

(A3) The use of named sub-procedures;the LOGO commands PO, POTS, etc.

(A4) Editing and debugging; LOGO commands EDIT, EDL etc.

(B1) Control of continuing processes with loops and/or recursion;

(B2) Use of variables;

(B3) Conditionals and stop rules;

(B4) Writing interactive programs;

.twinch 6
.block 3
The subgoals listed under learning elements of LOGO are divided into two
groups by the labels A and B. This is a post-hoc classification on the basis of
observation of these classes. It has become apparent that group A defines a coherent
and accessible minimum core knowledge of programming.  What this means and 
what it implies will be developed below in section 5 Summary of
Findings and in later chapters.

.block 4
3. Learning the "subject matter" of Turtle Geometry.  Major concepts include
.indent 8

.twinch 4.5
(A1) The use of numbers to measure lengths and angles; an intuitive as well as
a formal mastery of the turtle commands FORWARD, RIGHT etc. Formal and intuitive understanding of special
angles:  90, 360, 180, 10.

(A2) The group properties of numbers; seeing FORWARD -10 as the inverse
of FORWARD 10; addition mod 360 for angles.  

(A3) Internal relations of angles defining polygons and other regular
figures; POLY, SPIRALS.

.block 3
(A4) Similarity and symmetry; the similarity theorem in Turtle Geometry (if
you leave the angles alone and double the lengths you get the same shape
twice as big.)

(B1) The concept of state; state transparent procedures.

(B2) Non-cartesian coordinate systems; inventing an ad hoc coordinate
system, polar coordinates.

(B3) Curves as made up of  "infinitesimal" line segments; algorithm for
a circle as 
.br
REPEAT [FORWARD 1 RIGHT 1].

(B4) Combining movements; eg.
.br
SPIN 50 MOVET 50 
.br
produces a circle.

(B5) The total turtle trip theorem.

.twinch 6
.block 3
Items in group A are computation-theoretic forms of items of knowledge found
in standard school curricula and the students came with some prior related
knowledge.  Items in Group B, on the other hand, are computational forms of material
usually found in college courses on calculus, topology etc.

The difference of status between the two sets poses a dilemma for the evaluation of
the geometric component of our work. One can try to measure
the effects of the LOGO experience on the skills and concepts noted in
Group A.  For example, we find that our students came to sixth grade with very little
ability to make size comparisons between even grossly different angles
and that the group made striking gains in this respect on a post-test.
Although such pre- and post- tests were made in an exploratory spirit  over too
short a time and with too small a sample for us even to try to obtain
statistical significance, it is apparent that such findings
strongly suggest a utility of Turtle Geometry for school math. A math
teacher who knows the problem of getting 
students to understand  angular measure can relate the finding to his/her 
sense of what is important and of what is difficult in math education. 
Items in Group B pose more subtle questions.  Since the students start
off knowing no calculus whatsoever, any scrap of knowledge they pick up is
an "infinite" improvement. How can we tell if it is significant?  This
kind of argument is an incentive to concentrate attention on Group A. But
a real dilemma is posed by the fact that we believe on general intellectual
grounds that Group B items are very much more fundamental and important.
Thus we find ourselves in a particularly acute case of a very widespread
problem in education: that part of the work that is most important is
hardest to measure so that many pressures are exerted to concentrate on
the more superficial aspects.

Our resolution was to have the cake and eat it by exploring methods of
evaluation for both kinds of knowledge. However we did firmly decide --
as has been the policy of the MIT LOGO Group from the outset -- to put
the greater energy into what we consider to be the more important aspects.

.block 4
14. Understanding the Relation between Force and Motion

0It is now widely recognized  that most college students have incorrect ("Aristotelian")
ideas about physical dynamics and  that this is very hard to remedy by traditional teaching even at college level. With the small time available in these
LOGO classes it would have been absurd to set a goal of having the
students "understand dynamics". But  it was realistic to set
a more limited goal: to find situations in which the elementary school
student could meaningfully come to grips with laws of motion. The most
direct form of achieving this was the creation of computer "games"
in which the students' knowledge of turtles  could be used to 
manipulate dynamic turtles which in fact behave like Newtonian particles.
The educational objectives were  for the student to become sufficiently
involved in such	
activities to feel the contradiction between the turtle
and his intuition and to give him/her the intellectual tools that could in 
principle provide a way out of the dilemma. Our research goal was to
demonstrate the possibility 
of doing so, to identify more precisely 
the content of the students' "Aristotelian" physics and to probe its resistance to change.
This component of the work, reported in chapter 6, is of a much more
exploratory nature than the work on geometry with which we have had
very much more systematic experience in the past.


.block 4
15.  Developing and exhibiting  problem-solving skills.  

0Those skills stressed
in the present project and discussed in this report include

.indent 10
(a) "playing turtle" and "playing computer";
.br
.block 2
(b) the concept of a "bug" in a computer program and strategies for
debugging and planning;
.br
(c) procedural thinking;

ideas"; and

(e) the development of a language with which the children and adult
participants in the project were able to discuss these skills.

.block 5
12.3 Teaching Strategies

0In order to create a learning environment that would support the
learning of all of the children in a group, we set learning to be
comfortable with the computer as the first priority among the five sets
of learning/teaching goals that are set out above.
The initial projects and the initial knowledge needed were 
simple enough so that the children could learn them easily and
begin to feel in control right from the start.
Additional aspects of the language and projects of greater
sophistication were added when the individual child became comfortable with
knowledge previously acquired.
Decisions of what to introduce next were guided largely by what the
child needed to implement his or her ideas.
Directing the computer to carry out a series of steps involves
planning.  Gaps, misconceptions or errors in the planning lead to
"bugs" which have to be eliminated.  
In the course of working on a project, the teacher was able to help the
child to develop problem-solving skills needed to debug a
project as it progressed.  By discussing all of these things explicitly, a language
was built up that could be applied to other kinds of problem-solving
situations. 

Although the teacher had certain goals in mind for the students, he
allowed them a diversity of paths to get there.  This allowed for the fact,
clearly documented in the following chapters,
that since
different children tend to be successful with different aspects of LOGO,
they get to the same end result most effectively by following individually
chosen paths. Thus, for example,
some children were extremely adept at using elements of Turtle
Geometry
but had a great deal of
difficulty with the syntax of the computer language.  For others, the
reverse was true.  
As the students began to develop their own working styles and sets
of priorities, they developed a sense of confidence
about what they had done and  
could then set out along individualized
paths to learning LOGO.  This, of course, meant that the students did
not all cover the same subject
matter in any given period of time.  
The variety of successful paths to LOGO learning will be described in
the course of the report.

The initial contact with the computer typically centered
around learning the basic TURTLE commands
(FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT, LEFT and CLEARSCREEN), mastering basic elements
of syntax
such as spacing, and reading and taking note
of error messages.  The children would then be encouraged to define their own
tasks, typically involving drawing a specific, "simple" figure such as a
square, a house, a flower, or their initials.   
By keeping a written record of
the steps
as they went along,
they were easily able to translate geometric figures into their first
computer procedures.

Having procedures that could be saved, repeated, shown
off to friends and integrated into a larger design 
built the child's sense of pride and confidence.  
The fact that the child's first procedure was an individual one (even
if developed in collaboration with the teacher) was critical in setting
the tone of the child's blossoming relationship with the computer.

After the introductory phase the students' ways of working
rapidly diverged.  Some children were most interested in repeating
simple figures, introducing variations
and repeating again.  These children tended to use
recursion and
variables in a fairly short time.  Others had elaborate ideas
for computer drawings.  These children almost immediately
began to use superprocedures and subprocedures.  
An interchange of approaches occurred as
children began to show each other their work and to swap
ideas.  Children were encouraged to borrow each other's
procedures, even to copy them line-by-line at times.  (A lot of very
useful debugging can occur when a "copied" procedure leads to an
unexpected result.) 

As the classes continued, the teacher
helped the children choose projects or suggested projects
based on their interests and abilities.  His role in general was to
introduce
new material when appropriate, to help children improve their
programming styles through the use of model programs and suggestions for
debugging, to encourage the children to investigate certain areas more
deeply, and in general, to help them to
consolidate their learning.

The children met at intervals for group lessons where they could share and
discuss their work.  Each kept a notebook
of drawings, written plans, printed records of their procedures,
other information, 
and a brief daily comment about what they had
accomplished.  

Throughout the year, the teacher made a daily study of each child's
"dribble file"; i.e. the complete printed record of the child's
interaction with the computer.  In addition to providing much of the
data on which our study of the children's learning is based,
the dribble files provided an invaluable source of information to the
teacher about each child's working style,
problem-solving methods, strengths and weaknesses.  This
information was important in planning teaching strategies tailored to
each child's individual needs.

Data Collection
.block 8
13 Data  Collection

0Data sources included:

.twinch 4.5
1. Dribble files which recorded each child's daily interaction with the
computer.  Following each class, printouts of the dribble files were
carefully annotated by the teacher and/or a regular class observer.

2. The teacher's anecdotal records of each child's daily work.

3. A daily compilation of each child's work -- printouts of procedures,
hard copy of computer drawings, etc.

4.  Observations by Ms. Dunning, conducted on a regular basis; her
written reports focused
on child-teacher, child-child and child-computer
interactions. 

5. Regularly conducted observations by members of the MIT LOGO Group.

6.  Occasional observations by other members of the MIT faculty, Dr. George
Hein, other evaluation consultants and visitors to the LOGO classes.

7.  Informal meetings and workshops with the classroom teacher and the
school principal.

8.  A series of pre/post student interviews developed by the
project staff in collaboration with Dr. Hein and Ms. Dunning, and
carried out by Ms. Dunning.  Pre-interviews were useful
in providing us with baseline information about each child's interests,
skills, problem-solving abilities, and attitudes about themselves,
their school work and towards computers.  

9.  Interviews with the classroom teachers, conducted by Dr. Hein, after
the conclusion of each series of classes.

10.  Seminars and meetings with evaluation consultants who commented on
the data.

11.  Comments made at parents' meetings, school "open house" etc.

12.  An independent study made by Ms. C. Solomon on the diffusion
of LOGO knowledge in the school during the year following the work
reported here.

Research Themes
.block 6
14 Themes of Our Research

0We present our findings in terms of a number of themes.

The first is a set of concerns about whether children can 
program computers.  This cannot be formulated as a yes or no question.
If programming is sufficiently trivialized the answer is tautologically 
affirmative whereas if the criterion for what it is to program is made
sufficiently rigorous the answer would almost as clearly be negative.  A
better formulation would be to ask what kinds of programming can be
done by various categories of children.  But to give an exhaustive answer to
such a question would be a momentous, and perhaps even definitionally 
impossible task. At best it is a question that can be answered only
through a lengthy process of multiple experiments so that experiences
in different programming contexts could be compared. 
This study is a step in that direction. We
are possibly the first to have set up a well considered definition of
programming (that was not dictated by the accident of a particular programming
language simply being there) and to have published (which we are hereby doing)
a detailed account of how
a widely representative group of children actually fared with it. This is
not the place to delve deeply into the philosophy of design of the
definition of programming  embodied in the learning goals listed above. For
such a discussion the reader must consult our theoretical writings
(LOGO memos published by the A.I. Laboratory at M.I.T., and  a forthcoming
book Brainstorms:  Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas by S. Papert,
expected publication date February 1980) At most we can enumerate a few design criteria:

.indent 6
.block 3
(i) As computer science has developed a certain number of powerful
ideas have come to be recognized in the field of programming.  Among these is
the cluster of ideas related to the modularity of pure procedures, the
concept of top-down, "structured" programming etc.  One of our criteria
has been to capture for children as many as possible of these powerful
ideas including, in particular, the example cited of procedural modularity.
We have, of course, not been able to capture all the 
powerful ideas of computer science.  But we have made an attempt to capture some of them.

.block 3
(ii) There has grown up in the "computer culture" a rich tradition of using
computational ideas as tools to think about other matters.  For
example, the 
cognitive sciences now use ideas from Artificial Intelligence to think about 
psychology. 
We have tried to provide, within our concept of programming, ideas
about thinking styles -- ideas that can be used by children and their
teachers as tools to think about other matters of interest.

.block 3
(iii) Third, we refer to the "holding power" of programming. For many
people this activity has an exceptionally powerful quality of engagement
of attention. 
We believe that the search for the proper subset of programming 
knowledge to give children must take account of such affective
criteria.  Thus we pose the question:  what
kinds of programming will be most engaging for what categories of
children?  

.indent 0
With these criteria in mind, we fixed on one particular
vision of programming for the purpose of this study.
Our concerns have to do, on the one hand, with whether this approach to programming
does engage children,
whether in fact they learn to do it and, on the other hand, with whether what they
are learning is non-trivial, and whether it captures some of the intellectual
and aesthetic content of programming.

This brings us to our second theme, the relation between
learning to program and learning other areas of knowledge. In this study we have
picked one such area of knowledge: geometry. It is our contention that
computational concepts allow some essential parts of geometry to be captured
more concretely, more deeply and more intuitively than traditional
conceptual frameworks. For example where Euclid uses the static concept of
a point we use the dynamic one of a turtle. This allows a more direct and
intuitive access to formal geometry.  Another, perhaps more immediately obvious
example is the difference between the idea of angle in Euclidean geometry and
in Turtle Geometry.  In the latter an angle is an action, an amount of turning,
something that you (the would-be geometer) can do with your own body or
with your mental body image.  Similarly, the relation
between mathematics and physics becomes more immediate in this conceptual 
framework; for the Newtonian
particle turns out to be representable as a species of computational turtle
closely enough related to the geometry turtle for each to serve as
a means for thinking about the other.

In short,the general concept of this second theme is that of synergistic domains
of knowledge.  We maintain that LOGO and Turtle Geometry are synergistic
in the sense that it is easier to learn both together than to learn either
separately.  Perhaps the triplet geometry/physics/LOGO is even more
powerfully synergistic. Having explored the concept of synergistic
domains of knowledge, we raise the question:  how do we test the
correctness of the concept?

The third theme concerns just that question.  Here we are concerned with the
development of a methodology of evaluation.
We see certain problems in evaluating this kind of material.
For purposes of this discussion, we distinguish two evaluative methods
used here and describe the methodological difficulties inherent in
each.  

.twinch 4.5
.block 3
1(i) Observational Evaluation

0Consider two typical examples to illustrate the concept we have in
mind.  The first is the problem of deciding whether a given student has
mastered a particular set of topics such as group A of our list of
teaching objectives for LOGO.  In a traditional school context such
questions are often decided by "tests" or "quizzes".  We are convinced
that we have a better method in that the work of programming the
computer is a "continuous test in action".  By analyzing the students'
dribble files we can get a clear idea of his mastery of a given topic.
Of course, we must also analyze the context:  the student might have
copied the programs from a friend or he may use a particular concept
only in a limited situation.  Under normal operational conditions it
might not be possible to determine this context.  But in a research
context with many skilled observers present there can be no doubt that
assessment through analysis of the work itself provides a much more
thorough and accurate picture than assessment of test data.

.block 3
As a second example we consider the methodological difficulties in
researching questions such as:  whether working with angular measures
in a turtle context carries over to other situations.  Some ingenuity
is needed to find appropriate measuring  situations and there are
technical statistical problems about controls and sample size.  But we
see no great difficulty of principle and we shall describe below four
test situations in which our subjects show sufficiently marked improvement for us to
propose them as adequate tests for this kind of transfer.

What is common to these two examples is that our claims concern only the
immediate consequences of a particular learning experience.  The next
class illustrates a deeper kind of problem.

.block 5
1(ii) Comparative Evaluation

0In addition to asserting that the students in our group achieved
certain named criteria we would assert that they gained more than
students in other learning situations.  For example, we believe that
impressionistic, qualitative observation makes it quite evident that
the average children in our group learn very much more than similar
children do in any BASIC programming classes we have observed or read
about.  If the criteria and the teaching methods could be the same a
direct comparison could be made.  But they are not and really cannot
be.   Each programming language favors certain kinds of learning.
For example, LOGO is designed to facilitate "procedural thinking."
PILOT is designed to facilitate use of a certain kind of conditional.
BASIC forces the beginner to master a certain use of algebraic
variables in order to go beyond the most trivial programs.

We have carefully considered and rejected a methodology used by
Suppes and his collaborators in a comparative study of learning LOGO
versus learning a specially designed assembly language.  This
methodology ignores the "semantic content" of the work and uses
syntactic measures of learning such as counting   formally
recognizable mistakes.  Even though this study comes out favorably to
LOGO we feel that the methodology does not bear on the aspect we see
as most fundamental. The number of syntactic errors made by a student
bears very little relationship to the intellectual quality of his work.
And this is especially true in the context of LOGO which is designed to
allow the user to recover easily from syntactic slips and to encourage the
student to see "bugs" as something to contemplate and learn from rather than as something to avoid. The evaluative methodology must bear on the semantic content rather than the
syntactic form of the work.

We see two ways out.  The first is to provide the community of
educators interested in computer education with sufficiently richly
textured data to convey our sense of the intellectual richness of the
work produced by students in the LOGO environment.   Not everyone will
accept such data; some feel the lack of more statistical summative
measures to be a serious impediment to accepting our conclusions. However we
have found from experience that a sufficient number of educators are 
ready to accept a qualitative assessment of intellectual quality of the
students work as a valid basis for decisions for us to feel justified
in the effort of making public this rich (or, as it is often called nowadays
"thick") data.  We shall have made a useful contribution even if only  by
introducing into the debate about the choice of computer languages and about the
integration of computers into teaching   a more detailed level of analysis than	
has previously been available.  However, we feel that the data presented here
is sufficiently convincing to ensure that LOGO will get into a significant number of schools.

The second way out is, of course, to do longitudinal studies; to
follow the students' response to subsequent learning experiences
(e.g. in high school math or of another programming language).  We have
considered performing such experiments but considerations of the
problems of statistics and control procedures make it clear that
resources quite beyond ours would be necessary.  However, we believe
that such experiments will take place "naturalistically" as LOGO
becomes available to schools and have decided that the best policy is
to rely for the moment on our "thick" qualitative data as our main basis for
arguing the superiority of LOGO over other computer systems at least at 
the elementary and junior high school levels.

Programming Skills
.twinch 6
.block 3
The fourth theme concerns
the relationship between learning LOGO and
differences in cognitive style, and 
the learner's self image.  Findings here are significant both in terms
of new insights into theoretical psychology and as a basis for
developing more effective learning and teaching strategies.

.block 6
15. Summary of Findings

15.1 Theme 1: A Core Set of Programming Skills

0We approached the project with a definite concept of what we hoped
to have the students learn, namely at least the set of objectives in
group A and hopefully those in group B.

But we also had a flexible attitude
regarding both
method and the possibility of modifying specific content
goals.  Specifically, all the students were introduced to a pre-planned LOGO/turtle
learning unit  and were under some pressure to follow it.  But deviations 
from the plan were allowed when it became clear to the teacher that this
would lead to a more meaningful learning experience for the student and
for us.

.block 5
1Which Students Learned To Program0

Of the sixteen subjects we find that two did not achieve the set of
skills in group A and so cannot be said to have "learned to program" in any
significant sense. This does not mean that they learned nothing.
On the contrary, we have reason to believe that the experience profoundly
influenced at least one of them.

Our sample size was certainly too small to allow for any general
conclusions to be drawn
about the two  "non-programmers".  However, we do note that they were
the two students with the lowest scores on the National Achievement Tests: Tina
with a total battery percentile score of 3 (!) never learned to write procedures at all
while Ray, with a score of 24, learned to write procedures and even used
sub-procedures, but did not reach our criterion of being able to do
so independently of help from the teacher. Karl, the student with severe 
learning disabilities who did not have a test score, reached the criterion
quite adequately although in an interestingly personal way. (Tina's and
Karl's experiences are discussed in chapter 3, below, which focuses on
exceptional students. Further details of their work can be found in
Part III which contains individual reports written by the
teacher.)

We had hoped to be able to demonstrate that ALL students irrespective
of level of academic achievement could learn to program. In fact, the
strongest statement of this kind that
we can make on the basis of the present study is that
all students except those in the lowest quartile of school performance
did reach our criteria.However we are able to maker a much stronger
statement of a somewhat different and much more important kind: 
.twinch 4.5

.block 4
ALL students irrespective of performance level were engaged by 
computer activities in the LOGO environment; all underwent significant
observed learning and we made significant progress towards developing
a methodology of channelling this learning toward mastery of programming.

.twinch 6
The most significant idea in the direction of this general methodology is
a development of the concept of "micro-world" which has guided much of our
thinking over the past few years. The new development of the idea is well
illustrated by the experience of one of the subjects in the present study. This
is Deborah who will be discussed at several places in the following chapters. 
Very schematically Deborah's progress could be described as having three
phases. During the first she made little progress towards mastery of LOGO.
Her behavior was dominated by a lack of security and negative self image.
In a second phase Deborah defined for herself a very restricted sub-world
of the LOGO/turtle world by placing severe restrictions on what commands
she would use and what forms of projects she would undertake.  Within this
personally constructed micro-world she could feel sufficiently secure to
explore and become comfortable with the machine, the turtle and with the
formal context of programming The third stage developed just in time for
us to observe at the end of the study. Deborah spontaneously broke out from the 
self-imposed boundaries of her micro-world to begin exploring the larger
"official" turtle world.

Deborah's experience was made possible by the flexibility of the LOGO
computer system and by the teaching methodology that has developed with
it. Study of the details of what took place has led us to a general
research orientation of increasing the ease with which this pattern can
be followed by other students. From a theoretical point of view it has
confirmed our long-standing belief in the importance of creating systems
that can be appropriated in a personal way by individual students.

.block 5
1More Advanced Programming Concepts

0Since the work in the classes was highly project-oriented 
each student's needs for concepts in group B varied according to
the kind of project each adopted. Thus a count
of the students reaching a criterion of mastery of each concept
is not an informative measure. We note, however, that half the
students reached independent mastery of at least one of these group B
concepts.
Of these eight students, six also mastered
at least one other group B concept, while the other two were
apparently very close to doing so. The group B concept most frequently
mastered was loops and recursion.

The students who went farthest in mastery of the listed group B concepts
were Harriet, Gary, Kevin and Dennis. Reference to the list of achievement scores
(Table 1.1) shows rather close agreement between high scores and mastery of
group B concepts except for Kevin who had a low total score
but a high mathematical score.

We feel that these results confirm us in our separation of the group A
and Group B concepts
and in approaching programming via the first
set. We call attention to the fact that this is made possible  by specific
and deliberately designed features of LOGO.  By contrast, in BASIC, it is 
impossible to write interesting programs without using some of the "advanced"
concepts so that the "non-mathematical" students have difficulty getting
started and the gap between "mathematically-minded" students and others is  widened.

.block 5
15.2 Theme 2:  Turtle Geometry and LOGO as Synergistic domains

0As far as it appeared from our study,
the students did not distinguish between learning
programming and learning Turtle Geometry. Their initial work at the
computer, and in some cases all their work, consisted of developing
programs to produce graphic effects on the computer screen. The
separation of the knowledge required to develop these programs 
into programming knowledge,
arithmetical knowledge, geometrical knowledge, heuristic knowledge,  etc.
does not appear to have been of much concern to them.  They may be right in their
attitude.  We, however, felt it necessary to make these distinctions.
One reason was
to make our work more intelligible to educators 
used to thinking in terms of subjects each of which has a 
distinct curriculum. 
Another, more fundamental, reason was to classify LOGO-related knowledge
according to the type and style of intellectual skills required.
The boundaries between school subjects are often artificial. 
For example, it appears to us to be pedagogically and epistemologically 
wrong to separate "calculus" from "physics"  at the introductory levels.
The boundaries we have described, on the other hand,
reflect real differences in intellectual approach.   
These distinctions have
aided the students and provide a useful structure for discussing their
intellectual gains.

In chapters 4 and 5 of this report we 
shall present detailed
analysis of the intellectual content
of what one group of students involved in the project actually learned in LOGO/turtle
work.  That analysis, taken with chapter 6 -- where we show how turtle
work brings a beginning student into touch with some
fundamental ideas in physics --  shows that a great deal
of traditional knowledge is embedded in and exercised by work
with turtles. 

.block 5 
15.3 Theme 3:  Developing a Methodology of Evaluation of "Transfer"

0The methodology used in the present work has been to identify subsets of the
mathematical content of Turtle Geometry that bear on mathematical
knowledge already possessed by the students, 
for example, the idea of angle.
Although the students may have had only a vague idea, or none at all, of 
the meaning of degree as a measure of an angle, they do have
an intuitive sense of the relative sizes of angles. 
It is possible to ask whether
working with turtles changes their intuitive notion of angle and their skill
in making judgments about angles.   In a sense,
this a severe
test. The longer a piece of knowledge has been in place the harder it is to
modify and the question
here is 
whether an exposure of a few weeks to
turtles can affect knowledge about angles that has been in place for many years. 
Nevertheless, we did obtain some encouragingly positive
results through the use of evaluation methods devised especially for
this project.  A description of students' performance on several tasks
involved in the evaluation might shed some light on the carry-over of
turtle learning.

Analysis of Interview Data
.Block 5
1Analysis of Interview Data

0While this work is still in a fairly primitive stage,
we believe that our analysis of the interview data indicates some clear
gains made by the students as a result of the LOGO experience and suggests lines to follow 
in further research aimed at rigorous evaluation of the kinds of transfer studied
here.
  
In this
section we describe four of the tasks which were presented to the eight
students in the second semester classes, and analyze the gains made by
seven of them.  
(The eighth student, Tina, was unable to perform these tasks in a
consistent manner, or she performed them in a way that we have been
unable to understand.)  Results are shown in Tables 1.3 and 1.4.

.block 5
1Description of Tasks

0Task 1 involved estimation of length.  The students were asked to
compare a given line with five other lines drawn in various
orientations, and to draw three horizontal lines of their own (See Figure
1.1, p. 1.24)  This task should provide information about gains made in
estimating distances in the LOGO environment.  (Chapter 5, Section 2.2)

Task 2 involved estimation of angle, and was similar to Task 1, except
that the subject was not asked to draw any angles.  (See Figure 1.2, p.
1.25)
This task provides information that may indicate gains made in estimating angles.
(Chapter 5, Section 2.3)

Task 3 involved combining a series of Forward and Back Steps.  Subjects
were asked to replace the series of steps by a single step.  (See
figure 1.3, p. 1.26)  This could provide information about gains made in
understanding the group properties of number, as students learn to
combine TURTLE steps in carrying out LOGO projects.  (Chapter 5,
Section 3).

Task 4 was more complex, and involved drawing a line on three grid-like maps of
increasing complexity,  and giving directions to move from one point to
another on the grid.  (See figure 1.4, p. 1.27)  This task could
provide information about how accurately subjects give directions,
whether they distinguish right from left in different orientations,
whether they can transfer visual information to verbal information, and
in some cases, how well they can recognize errors and debug them.  It
combines aspects of Turtle Geometry, and procedure writing and debugging.
.page
The results of these tasks for the seven students who attempted them
are shown in Table 1.3.  The students are considered to have made
major improvement, slight improvement or no improvement.  An
interpretation of no improvement may indicate that the subject made
compensating errors, or that the subject performed exactly the same in
both pre- and post-test situations.  In six cases
subjects carried out the tasks perfectly on pre- and post-tests.

1NOTE ON SIGNIFICANCE OF TESTS0

Our original research plan as set out in our proposal to the NSF did not
include an evaluation of the transferable results of the LOGO experience.
As we have repeatedly remarked in this report such an undertaking would require
more extensive work than could be carried out within the time frame of this
project. What we did undertake to do was to explore possible evaluative
procedures. The four tests cited above are presented in this spirit. We
cannot be sure that these results will stand up to careful further study.
What we can say is that of all the "transfer" observations we did make,
these four  recommend themselves on combination of the following criteria: they
are intuitively plausible,they seem to be robust,they are in an area that is
of obvious interest to schools and they are concerned with phenomena that are
in principle measurable.

In order to transform these results into hard data a number of careful controls
will be necessary. The one  control we performed was to ensure that mere
repetition of the tests would not lead to a comparable change in performance.
We did this by giving the pre- and post- tests to a group of subjects who
did not have a LOGO experience in between. We found no systematic change. However
many obvious questions would have to be faced by a serious control. Amongst these
are the following. It is possible that a much lesser experience involving the
use of angles would be sufficient to produce the improvement we saw in intuition
of angle, so we have to ask what other learning experiences could produce comparable results.
We are sure that there was a change in our group. We have no idea about how
this amount of change relates to the normal pattern of intellectual development.
One must ask whether this is a "year's worth" of development or more or less.
Finally, and most importantly, we have to ask how the improved abilities actually
integrate into other intellectual activities of the children.  Will it be observed
in the context of a trigonometry course? Will these students learn navigation
more easily and effectively?

There are many approaches to such evaluative questions. We expect different 
researchers to pick them up in different ways, as indeed we shall ourselves.
For the moment we have made a commitment to one particular approach, namely
the longitudinal study of groups of children over a period of at
least two years. One such study involving a two year-long LOGO experience
starting at age eight is already underway and some others are being planned.

Identifying Intellectual Styles
15.4 Theme 4:  Identifying Intellectual Styles

0The study has provided us with new and important data concerning the
diversity of intellectual styles, 
and the effect of learning
LOGO on an individual student's image of herself or himself as a learner.
For example, even when two students end up with
very similar products, an analysis of the dribble file, which shows the
process by which they arrived at their result, indicates
that there is no sense in which they "just did the same thing". The data
from the project has yielded some very fine examples of convergence of
different processes and has contributed to further work on classifying
intellectual styles.  We see this as extremely important both for
theoretical psychology and for the development of strategies for
teaching and learning.

The most striking dichotomy of styles one sees in a  LOGO environment
is that between what computer programmers would refer to as "bottom up"
as against "top down"
programming. The top down programmer is a planner. He starts with a
clear model of an end result.  His first step is to translate this
into a program the details of which are left blank but whose structure has been
fixed from the outset.  Here, 
Donald represents the extreme example of a top-down programmer who
worked steadily to turn a hand-drawn face into a computer program
that drew a face remarkably like it. Over a period of twelve sessions
Donald worked to fill in the gaps in a program, HEAD, that had  taken
on its almost final form by the second of the twelve sessions. 
(See pp. 2.12, 2.13,
below)

.block 5
.adjust
0Deborah also produced a face.  A glance at her first and last drawings will show
immediately that she was following a very different process. She has
been much freer than Donald in allowing the final product to emerge
as she went along. The difference is even more striking when we look at
the stages of emergence of her procedure as shown on p 2.8. The procedure
was built up line by line as she worked at it with little trace of
Donald's preference to structure the whole before beginning on the parts. Following
Levi-Strauss, Bob Lawler has proposed to call Deborah's cognitive style a "bricolage"
or tinkering.  A certain well-established intellectual tradition tends to
look down on the style of the bricoleur and see the obsessional planner
as the model to follow and impose on children.  Research by Lawler and
others at M.I.T. as well as the results found in the Lincoln study indicate
that the style of bricolage may be much more natural and much more
productive than is usually admitted. Certainly we are convinced that
the turning point in Deborah's development in  LOGO  came when
the teacher found a way to let her feel supported  in  developing an
extreme form of bricolage in her work.  Possibly this was one of the first
times when this girl felt that she had achieved success and acknowledgment
through work in her own personal style. And her response to this sense of
security was so great that she was able to make some tentative essays into
the planner's style of work. Thus even educators who do not admit
bricolage as a valid mode of work in itself should give it credit as a
stepping stone to the ability to experiment with a variety of styles.

(More details of Deborah's work can
be found in chapter 2, below, and in her profile in Part III)

Acknowledgments

16. Acknowledgments

0This project has been a collaboration between the public school system of
Brookline, Massachusetts and
the MIT LOGO
Group.  Without the full participation of a large number of people from
both systems, the Lincoln School LOGO Project could never have
occurred.  
Dr. Robert I. Sperber, Superintendent of Brookline Schools, and Mr.
Gerry Cote, the Principal of Lincoln School, are greatly to be thanked
for their help and cooperation.  All three sixth grade teachers,
Ms. Lisa Hirsh, Mr. Bob Lewis and Ms.  Florence Regolino,
enthusiastically supported the project and the participation of the sixth grade
students who were its most immediate beneficiaries.  
The involvement of
students and staff of the Brookline school system was an 
essential ingredient of the project.

Trial classes at Lincoln School were taught by Dr. Dan Watt, a
Brookline teacher whose services were subcontracted to the project on a
full-time basis.  Dr. Dan Watt also had primary responsibility for
collecting data about each child's progress and coordinating all the
activities at the school.

The trial classes were planned and materials for them were developed by
members of the LOGO Group, Professors Seymour Papert, Harold Abelson,
Andy diSessa and Jeanne Bamberger.  Dr. Sylvia Weir coordinated data
collection and analysis.
These members of the LOGO Group also participated in ongoing
observation of the trial classes, revision of activities and in a
series of project meetings which monitored the progress of the
classes.  MIT students Ellen Hildreth and Ursula Wolz also observed
trial classes, collected data and participated in project meetings.

Our approach to data collection and analysis was developed over many
years as an integral part of the research work of the  Laboratory.
The use of dribble files was initiated by Cynthia Solomon. The tradition
of detailed class commentaries was developed by  Solomon,  Gerianne
Goldstein
and Kiyoko Okumura.  The plan for this study was developed
by the project staff in  
consultation with Professor George E. Hein and Ms. Stephanie (Penny)
Dunning of the Program Evaluation and Research Group of Lesley College,
who also assisted us in developing the pre/post interviews used with
our experimental subjects.  Ms. Dunning  conducted the pre/post
interviews, and observed the classes at regular intervals.  Prof. Hein
conducted classroom observations, interviewed the students' classroom
teachers after each round of experimental classes, and participated in
several project meetings.

An important aspect of the project was the way in which the computer
culture was able to spread within the school.  In addition to the
experimental classes for our sixteen subjects, LOGO classes were also
provided for the rest of the sixth graders in the school.  These
classes were taught by volunteers, primarily MIT students, who were
supervised by Dr. Watt, and Professors Abelson, diSessa and Bamberger.
The volunteer teachers who contributed greatly to the overall success
of the project were:  Harvey Alcabes, Enno Becker, Kou-Mei Chuang, John
Hengeveld, Danny Hillis, Rene Margulies, Margaret Minsky, Brian
Schwartz, and Ursula Wolz.  An after school computer club, led by MIT
graduate student Jose Valente provided an opportunity for seventh and
eighth grade students to learn LOGO, and for certain sixth graders to
extend and deepen their LOGO knowledge.
In addition to teaching, these students contributed beyond measure to
the intellectual atmosphere surrounding the project.  Since it was in
the nature of this project to be "conservative" in developing a version
of LOGO that could be integrated into schools in an immediate horizon
and in the nature of these students to be "revolutionary" in looking
beyond such immediate horizons, many of the student generated ideas
have not found a place in this report.  They will make themselves
increasingly felt in future research directions.

The project's technical components including hardware and
software support were carried out  by Ron Lebel and Brian Silverman.

Data analysis was carried out by the entire project staff.  Our 
analysis owes a great deal to discussions with Professors
Hermine Sinclair-de Zwaart of the University of Geneva and Guy
Groen of McGill University, both of whom visited classes, attended
project meetings, and commented critically on our first attempts at analysis.

We had a number of visitors to our experimental classes, many of
whom offered helpful  comments.  Two visitors whose
comments were especially useful were Cynthia Solomon and Kiyoko Okumura-
Montpetit, both highly experienced LOGO teachers and innovators.
Cynthia Solomon conducted a follow-up study in the school during
the subsequent (i.e. the current) school year whose results 
will be published in due course.  Another kind of insight was
contributed by Susan Hartnett who attended a number of classes and
filmed one as part of an experiment in the use of film to capture
aspects of the children's work.  Perhaps the most disappointing aspect
of the project was its inability, imposed by lack of resources, to
follow up on new insights contributed by visitors.  However, many of
them have been absorbed into future oriented thinking.

Behind the scenes at all times was Gregory Gargarian who is listed in
official papers as "secretary" but who in fact did enormously more than
can properly be described by that (or perhaps any other) term.  In
addition to orchestrating a complex, movement of machines, people and
texts so that the right ones would be in the right places at the right
times he was the person who was most in touch with the day to day needs
of the project and of the people in it.

An Interim Report,
describing the work of the first eight students, and containing our
first attempt at data analysis, was written by the entire project
staff, and coordinated by Sylvia Weir.  This report was published  as
LOGO Memo #49 in the spring of l978.

This final project report was written by Prof. Seymour Papert, Dr. Dan Watt,
Prof. Andy diSessa and Dr. Sylvia Weir, under the overall direction of Prof. Papert.
Part III, containing individual student profiles was written by
Dr. Watt.

Editorial  contributions were made by John Berlow.
