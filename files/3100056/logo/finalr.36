11.1 Overview of the Project


0The M.I.T. LOGO group has developed over the years an approach to
teaching programming and to using computational environments to
facilitate the learning of a variety of subject matters as well as the
enhancement of general intellectual development.  The project reported here 
consisted of (a) defining a particular "learning unit" embodying this
general approach and (b) studying the implantation of this unit in a public
school.  The content of the learning unit includes :       

.indent 6
(a) the elements of writing computer programs in the language LOGO

(b) topics in mathematics and science based on the use of the 
concept of "turtle" as a bridge between traditional bodies of knowledge
and new computational methods for understanding and for learning these
topics

(c) formulations of a number of heuristic methods in a LOGO/turtle
framework. 

.indent 0
The school used for the project is in the lower socio-enconomic
section of the town of Brookline, Mass.  The student population spanned
the range of academic performance from students who have presented
serious learning difficulties to students who have shown exceptional
mathematical talent.  

The learning  unit is designed to be realistic in its
length (approximately 30 class hours per student) as well as in the
teacher-training and computer system necessary to implement it.  Since
the primary purpose of the study was to document the students' patterns
of learning, we were rigorous in selecting typical students and in
confining their interaction with the computer to the conditions
prescribed by the experiment.  We were less rigorous in selecting a
"typical" teacher and in standardizing the teacher training process.
Indeed, while staying within the general ball-park of what we consider
to be feasible under normal operational conditions, we allowed
ourselves a "safety margin" in giving our teacher 2 or 3 times the
extent of training we consider to be minimally necessary.

Another area in which we gave ourselves a "safety margin" was in the
use of a computer with more power and flexibility than would be
generally available to schools at a reasonable price.  Apart from
allowing us
to modify the conditions of
work of the students in the study, the machine's power contributed
essentially to the collection of data which includes a complete
transcript of all interactions with the machine in addition to notes
taken by the teacher and by observers.

In October 1977 a computer laboratory consisting of four independent
LOGO computer systems was established in a classroom of the William H.
Lincoln School, Brookline, Massachusetts.  Sixteen representative
students selected from among fifty sixth graders were provided with
special LOGO classes for approximately four hours per week.  Two groups
of four students were exposed to approximately 25 hours  of LOGO
experiences over a seven week period in the Fall; two additional groups
of four students were exposed to approximately 36 hours of LOGO
experiences over a ten week period in the Spring.  The work of the
sixteen experimental subjects was carefully monitored by means of
annotated dribble files, teacher's observations, and by regular
observations by members of the MIT LOGO Group and outside consultants.
The students were interviewed before and after their LOGO experience to
establish a base-line of interests, abilities, and attitudes from which
we could assess each student's progress during the LOGO classes.
Additional feedback was provided by the regular teaching staff of the
school by means of routine meetings and conversations, and by
interviews conducted after the end of each series of LOGO classes.

11.3 Analysis and Publication of Findings0

0A preliminary analysis of the performance of the first set of
eight subjects was published as LOGO Memo No. 49: "Interim Report of
the LOGO Project in the Brookline Public Schools," in June 1978.  
After the formal work with children came to an end in June 1978 we
began a new analysis of data which extended the Interim Report in
several ways:

.indent 6
.block 8
(a) all sixteen subjects are now included

(b) the analysis is much more detailed and systematic

(c) we now have data on the learning of physics as well as of mathematics
in the LOGO/turtle environment used by the project 

(d) we have data on one student whose primary gains were in the use of language
rather than in mathematics or science.

.indent 0
The results of this analysis take the form of a book-length document to be
published in June 1979 as a LOGO Memo.  Four copies will be sent to the
N.S.F. (c/o Dr.Andrew Molnar.)  Further copies can be obtained by writing
to "LOGO Laboratory, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge  02139." We refer
to this document in later scetions of this report as "Data Analysis" and
for external reference as "Sixteen Young Programmers: An Analysis of the
LOGO/Turtle Project in the Lincoln School,Brookline Mass."  We are
exploring the possibility of having the document published as a book.

It is not meaningful to summarize here the contents of "Data Analysis";
interested people are refered to the document itself.  However in the
following section we provide a qualitative summary of the categories of
general conclusions that can be drawn from the work.

11.2 Summary of Findings0

The product of the work can be seen on several levels.

.twinch 4.5
.block 4
A DEMONSTRATION OF FEASIBILITY:  
.br
Elementary school students CAN learn to program computers. Our analysys
of data constitutes by far the most detailed publicly avalailable
documentation of how a group including average and below average
elementary school students actually learned to program under realistic
school conditions.  (Data analysis:  Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4)

.block 4
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BENCHMARKS:  
.br
We have a list of programming skills achievable within the typical time
limits of a single semester course.  As more knowledge about learning
to program is acquired the set of skills achievable in this time will
undoubtedly change both qualitatively and quantitatively.  In the
meantime the set of skills established here will serve as a guide-line
to teachers and as a base line for further research.  (Data analysis:
Chapters 1 and 4)

.block 4
A COGNITIVE ANALYSIS OF PROGRAMMING
.br
Our data on patterns of learning provides insights into the cognitive
structures underlying programming and the difficulties encountered by
students.  (Data analysis:  Chapter 4)

.block 4
A WINDOW ON THE ADVANTAGES OF LOGO-LIKE LANGUAGES OVER BASIC-LIKE LANGUAGES
.br
It is intuitively obvious to us that while some of the students in our study
would have learned to program in a standard BASIC programming environment
others would certainly not have learned under those conditions. The latter
group made essential use of features  designed so that LOGO would be
accessible to mathematically naive and even to mathophobic students.
Although we have no rigorous proof of these judgments we expect that anyone
who has tried to teach BASIC to children will be able to see how what
might seem to be small differences between LOGO and BASIC allow certain
children to overcome obstacles that often block entry to the world of
programming.


.block 4
A DEMONSTRATION OF MATHEMATICAL LEARNING IN A COMPUTATIONAL ENVIRONMENT:
.br
Our students were learning mathematics as an integral part of
the same learning experience that led to skill in programming.  The
data collected here illuminates this process.  And just as we have
established "benchmarks" for the learning of programming at elementary
school level we have also established benchmarks for the learning of
the topic in computational mathematics we have called "Turtle
Geometry".  (Data analysis:  Chapter 5)

11.4  Articulation With Further Work0

We believe that the work reported here constitutes a sufficient demonstration
of feasibility and of educational value to justify the implantation of the
LOGO/turtle learning unit in elementary schools.  The principle obstacle
to this happening on a large scale is the fact that most computers in schools
were designed for a very different mode of use. The machines in general use
have two kinds of limitations to the transposition of the LOGO/turtle unit
used in the present project: limitations of memory and limitations of the
display system used. The latter is more serious.  Computer systems such as the
TRS-80 which have no graphics capability would require serious modifications
in order to permit the transposition.  Fortunately several systems have
a graphics capability which  allows  the transposition to take place with
some changes in the detail although not in the principle of the LOGO/turtle
unit.  These include the Apple, the Itari and the recently announced T.I.
computers. The extensions of memory required to make the transposition are 
less serious, requiring only an "add on" to the existing system rather than 
a change in structure.  A version of the LOGO/turtle unit has in fact actually
been implemented for the T.I. computer with a memory extension.  A 
project to make a transposition to the Apple is under way. Thus the hardware
barrier that has blocked the spread of LOGO for many years seems to have
broken down just at the appropriate moment when we are also able to provide
(through the publication of the Data Analysis from the project reported here)
the kind of information schools will need in order to adopt it.

Some "developmental" work needs to be done in order to make the transpositions
and we have made a proposal to the N.S.F. D.I.E.S. program to carry it
out.  If
this proposal is accepted we can expect to see LOGO/turtle methods being
used in schools by the school year 1980/81 on a sufficient scale to make
possible a new set of research issues concerned with the effects of LOGO
work as it becomes more closely integrated into the school.

An important step in the direction of understanding how much integration is
possible and what its consequences might be will be taken by a project in
the Lamplighter School in Dallas, Texas.  This project will introduce nearly
one hundred  LOGO computers into a small elementary school.  The underlying
philosophy of the project is to treat the computer as a "free resource"
for the entire third grade.  This means not only that the computers will be
available at all times for work at school, but also that the children will
be able to take the machines home and keep them there for extensive periods.
One of the many conjectures one might make about the project is that the
LOGO/turtle methods we have been testing in a school context
might be transferable to learning in a home context where other members of the
family will be able to have access to the computers brought home by the
children participating in the study.

.block 6
12. Organization and Teaching in the LOGO Classroom

2.1  Goals of Teaching LOGO

0The LOGO language and introductory LOGO activities can form the
basis for several different kinds of learning, integrated in a complex
way into the actual classroom activities of the children.  While these
types of learning can and do occur simultaneously, it is valuable to
list them as separable goals, and to assign priorities, for the purpose
of developing a classroom organization and teaching strategies.  The
major goals of teaching LOGO, as defined in our research proposal are:

.indent 6
1. Learning to feel comfortable with a computer, and in control of what
the computer does.  The child will learn that s/he can decide what
the computer will do, and have the computer carry out a set of
instructions.  There are many ways in which children can use the
computer in their own fashion.

2. Learning the elements of the LOGO computer language.  This includes
commands that are included in the language, how to write and name
procedures and subprocedures, use recursion and/or iteration, how to
define,  name and use variables, as well as conditionals and stop rules,
etc.

3. Learning the "subject matter" of Turtle Geometry.  This includes
concepts involving measurement and estimation of angles and distances;
the relations among angles and distances, necessary to produce certain
well defined shapes such as a square, triangle, polygon, star or
circle; such general geometric concepts as similarity, scaling and
symmetry, etc.

4. Learning to develop problem solving skills.  This includes such
things as procedural thinking, "playing turtle", "playing computer",
the concept of a "bug" in a computer program, and strategies for
debugging and planning, the usefulness of generalizations or "big
ideas"; and the development of a language with which to discuss all
these things.

.indent 0
The LOGO language and computer activities are designed so that all
these things can happen simultaneously as the child works on projects
which he or she has initiated.

The initial projects and the initial knowledge needed are 
simple enough that a child can learn them relatively easily, and
begin to feel successful, and in control, right from the start.
Additional aspects of the language and projects of greater
sophistication are added as each child becomes comfortable with them.
Directing the computer to carry out a series of steps involves
planning.  Gaps, misconceptions or errors in the planning lead to
"bugs" which have to be eliminated.  Thus the teacher can help the
child begin to develop problem solving skills needed to debug the
child's work.  By discussing all of these things explicity, a language
is built up that can be applied to other kinds of problem-solving
situations. 

In practical situations, with a group of children and one teacher,
different children tend to be successful with different aspects of LOGO.
Some children are extremely adept at using elements of Turtle
Geometry
but have a great deal of
difficulty with the syntax of the computer language.  For others, the
reverse may be true.  
In order to create a learning
environment that supports the learning of all of the children in a
group, we have made learning to be comfortable with the computer:
enabling the learner to feel in control -- the first priority among the four
goals.  As the students develop their own working styles and sets
of priorities, they develop a sense of confidence
about what they have
done.  On the other hand, they will not all cover the same subject
matter in any given period of time.  
Our experience shows that children have many different
approaches to LOGO, and successfully follow several different learning paths.

.block 5
12.2 Organization of the LOGO Classroom

0The classroom itself consists of four independent microcomputers,
each with its own keyboard, display screen and disk drive.  A printer is
available for use with one of the computers when necessary.  The
children are supplied with notebooks, graph paper drawing paper,
different kinds of pens, pencils and markers, as well as a full set of
stationary supplies.  A small round table, near a blackboard 
provides a setting for group lessons or discussions, and
for informal conversation among the children.  Children's work is
displayed on bulletin boards around
the room.

.block 5
12.3 Teaching Strategies in the LOGO Classroom

0A child's initial contact centers around learning the basic TURTLE commands,
FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT, LEFT and CLEARSCREEN; mastering syntax matters
such as spacing, and reading and taking notice
of error messages.  The children are encouraged to define their own
tasks, typically involving drawing a specific, "simple" figure such as a
square, a house, a flower, or their initials; and to record the steps
as they go along, so that they will be able to "teach it to the
computer".  The latter involves an early introduction to procedure writing.

It is at this point, that the child begins to feel a sense of control:
"I made that design!" Procedures can now be saved, repeated, showed
off to friends, integrated into a larger design.  The importance of the
child's first procedure being an individual one (even if it's an idea
that the teacher suggested and helped with ) is very critical in
determining the child's relationship with the computer as the
classes progress.

From this point on, each child's work is different.  Some get
interested in repeating simple figures, introducing simple variations
and repeating again.  These children might get into using recursion and
variables in a fairly short time.  Others might have elaborate ideas
for computer drawings.  These children might get into use of
superprocedures and subprocedures right away.  The best of all worlds
occurs when children begin to show each other their work and swap
ideas and approaches.  Children are encouraged to borrow each other's
procedures, even to copy them line-by-line at times.  A lot of very
useful debugging can occur when a "copied" procedure leads to an
unexpected result.

As the classes continue, the teacher takes on a guiding role
helping the children choose projects or suggesting projects to
children based on their interests and abilities.  S/he introduces
new material when appropriate, encourages children to improve their
programming styles by the use of model programs and suggestions for
debugging, encourages the children to investigate certain areas more
deeply, and in general, helps the children consolidate their learning.

At intervals, the children meet for group lessons and to share and
discuss their work.  They each keep a notebook in which they make
drawings, write out plans, record information, keep printed records of
their procedures, and make a brief daily comment about what they have
accomplished.  

Throughout the classes, the teacher makes a daily study of each child's
"dribble file" -- the complete printed record of the child's
interaction with the computer.  In addition to providing much of the
data on which our study of the children's learning is based,
the dribble files are an invaluable source of information to the
teacher as to what each child's working style, methods of
problem-solving, strengths and weaknesses really are.  This information
is used in planning the individual teaching strategies that are
developed for each child as the classes progress.

.block 7
13. Research Methodology

0We rely primarily on qualitative methodology:  on observations,
interviews and documentation, organized in a carefully designed
framework, which provides both a conceptual structure for the project
and a data management system.

Our research design was developed by our project team in a series of
meetings with Dr. George Hein and Ms. Stephanie (Penny) Dunning,
consultants to Education Development Center, who also participated in
the data collection.  The methods of analysis owe a great deal to
discussions with Prof. Hermine Sinclair-de Zwaart of the University of
Geneva who visited classes and commented critically on our first
attempts at analysis.

.block 7
0The following data collection methods supplied the information upon
which this report is primarily based:

.twinch 4.5
1. Dribble files which recorded each child's daily interaction with the
computer.  Following each class, printouts of the dribble files were
carefully annotated by the teacher and/or a regular class observer.

2. The teacher's anecdotal records of each child's daily work.

3. A daily compilation of each child's work -- printouts of procedures,
hard copy of computer drawings, etc.

4.  Observations by Ms. Dunning, conducted on a regular basis, and
written up to focus on child-teacher, child-child and child-computer
interactions. 

5. Regularly conducted observations by members of the MIT LOGO Group.

.twinch 6
The following sources of data were useful in corroborating other
findings, offering fresh insights into children's experiences providing
information about transfer of both skills and attitudes to other areas
of school, and understanding the overall community reaction to the project:

.twinch 4.5
6.  Occasional observations by members of the MIT faculty, Dr. George
Hein, other evaluation consultants and visitors to the LOGO classes.

7.  Informal meetings and workshops with the classroom teacher and the
school principal.

8.  A series of pre/post student interviews developed by the
project staff in collaboration with Dr. Hein and Ms. Dunning, and
carried out by Ms. Dunning.  Pre-interviews were useful
in providing us with baseline information about each child's interests,
skills, problem solving abilities, and attitudes towards themselves,
their school work and towards computers.  Post-interviews were not
as useful as we had hoped in providing external information about
student gains during the LOGO classes.  While some students showed
improvements on some tasks, they showed regression on others, and we
have not been able to establish enough consistencies to draw any
conclusions from the post-interview data.

9.  Interviews with the classroom teachers conducted by Dr. Hein, after
the conclusion of each series of classes.

10.  Seminars and meetings with evaluation consultants who commented on
the data.

11.  Comments made at parents' meetings, school "open house" etc.

12.  An independent study made by Ms. C. Solomon of the diffusion as
seen in the year following the work reported here of LOGO knowledge in
the school.

14.  Detailed Organization of the Project

4.1  Selection of Students for the Trial Classes

0The subjects for the trial classes were chosen on the basis of
consultations among the project staff and the regular classroom
teachers.  The teachers were asked to rate the 50 sixth-grade students
on a 3-point scale of overall ability in school work: "average", "below
average", and "above average".

The students were then divided into groups of four, so as to achieve
the following:

.nofill
.indent 6
--a range of abilities within each group
--a balance of boys and girls in each group
--a minimum of scheduling problems in relation to other classroom activities
--compatibility among individuals in the group to ensure that the
  groups could be as supportive as possible for each child

.indent 0
.adjust
Two of these 4-unit groups from each of the two school classes formed
the 16 subjects of the experiment.  The range of abilities of students
in the trial classes, was compared with the range of abilities in the
sixth grade as a whole, to ensure that our sample was a representative
one:

//n = 50/n = 16
.spread

/III. Below Average/16/6


.adjust
In addition to the teacher ratings of student abilities, the latest
national achievement test scores of students in our sample were
compared to the scores in the entire sixth grade.  In this way we
confirmed that our sample was representative, although no attempt was
made to achieve a random selection, or to match our subjects with a
control group.

An additional commitment to the school was that no child in the 6th
grade was to be excluded from the LOGO experience and this was achieved
using M.I.T. student volunteers.  These latter children do not form
part of the experiment and their activities are not recorded here.

During April of 1978, the school administered a battery of achievement
tests to all sixth grade students.  Their results, made available to
us, allow us to rank fifteen of our subjects according to their
percentile ratings when compared to national norms (the sixteenth
subject, Karl, was not tested with his classmates because of severe
learning problems).

14.2  Scheduling of the Trial Classes
.br
.sp 13

0Fall classes met four times a week, for periods ranging from 40
minutes to 90 minutes.  In the Spring it was possible to arrange to
hold the classes three times a week, and to standardize the times at
approximately 80 minutes for each class.  Each of the four groups had
approximately 4 hours of exposure to LOGO per week.  Late notification
of the award by the National Science Foundation resulted in a late
start for the fall classes, and a total duration of approximately three
weeks less than that of the Spring classes.

.block 5
14.3  Scheduling of Observations

0A major source of data for the project was derived from written and
verbal comments of observers who attended the trial classes.  These
observations were of four types.

.twinch 4.5
1. Members of the MIT LOGO Group -- faculty, and students.  At least
two different MIT observers visited each of the trial classes once each
week.  Bi-weekly meetings were held at which the entire project staff
shared their observations and monitored the progress of the classes.

2. A regular consultant observer, Ms. Penny Dunning, visited the trial
classes weekly in the Fall, and bi-weekly in the Spring.  Her written
observations of each session she visited form a significant part of the
data of the experiment.

3. Other consultants paid irregular visits to the trial classes.  Their
insights were shared in group meetings and in written reports to the project.

4. Visitors to the project were asked to leave a written comment before
departing.

.twinch 6
.block 5
14.4 Student and Teacher Interviews

0Interviews were conducted with each of our 16 students both before
and after their LOGO experiences.  The students in the Fall classes
were interviewed in October, and again in January.  The students in the
Spring classes were interviewed in October, and were given a second
pre-interview in February, to form a comparison with the students who
had completed their LOGO classes in the Fall.  The students in the
Spring Classes were also given a post-interview, following the
completion of the classes in June.

The three teachers of our students were interviewed by Dr. George Hein
after the Fall series of classes, and again after the Spring classes.
