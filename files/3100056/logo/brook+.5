1Theme 2  Turtle geometry and Logo as Synergistic domains

0As far as we know the students did not distinguish between learning
programming and learning turtle geometry. Their initial work at the
computer, and in some cases all their work , consisted of developing
programs to produce grapghic effects on the computer screen. The
separation of the knowledge required into programming knowldge,
arithmetic knowledge, geometric knowledge, heuristic knowldge  etc
is not of much concern to them. They may indeed be right in their
attitude. However we felt it necessary to make these distinctions.
One reason for doing so is to make our  work intelligible to educators who are
used to thinking in terms of subjects each of which has a 
distinct curriculum. But there are also more fundamental reasons.
The boundary between school subjects is often artificial. For
example it appears to us to be pedagogically and epistemologically 
wrong to separate "calculyus" from "phyics"  at the introductory levels.
But some boundaries reflect real differences in intellectual personality
and students gain from being aware of these.

In chapters 4 and 5 of this report we make a much more detailed
analysis than we have ever done before of the intellectual content
of what at least one groupof students actually learned in LOGO/turtle
work and in chapter 6 we show how working with the new species of
dynamic turtles brings a beginning student into touch with some
fundamental ideas in physics. This analysis shows that a great deal
of traditional knowledge is embedded in and exercised by work
with turtles. To see how much the reader will have to browse at
the chapters themelves. Here we pose two general questions and
answer them by referring to just one example. The questions are:

Why is it better to learn traditional concepts in this non-traditional
setting?

and

Do the concepts so learned transfer to traditional settings?

Our example is the idea of angular measure and its realtion to
similarity. In Euclidean geometry one learns that similar triangles
have equal angles and proportional sides. The very satement of the theorem is
eleusive for many students and the possible use of it even more
obscure. In turtle gemetry  a more general and powerful
theorem acquires a very concrete and utilitarian form. If you have a program
to draw a picture, this is what you do to draw "the same" picture  twice as
big: leave all the inputs to RT and LT just as they are and double all
the inputs to FD and BK. Similar figures (same shape, differnt size) have
the same angles and proportional lengths. Thus writing a program gives
a sense of purpose and a concretness to a piece of geoemtric
knpowldge. But at the same time the geometric purpose gives sense to
a piece of programming knowledge. For many of our students the idea of
variable is elusive until they meet it in the context of making a program
capable of drawing not just one figure but a whole family of figures, and
the families that first occur to a beginner are families of similar
figures such as squares ,equilateral triangles and circles.

How do we test whether knowledge so acquired will transfer to other
contexts?  In many cases the answer has to be: wait and see. When the
sixth grader who learned the idea of similarity through programming gets
to high school geoemtry we could (in principle) find out whether
he takes to it more readily. Such answers are not silly. Indeed 
the M.I.T. LOGO group is presently embarking on much longer
range studies than the present one. But the justification
of the long range study has to be data obtained from more restricted
work. 

The methodology used in the present work is to identify subsets of the
mathematical content of turtle geometry that bear on mathemtical
knowledge already possessed by the students. The formal idea of similarity
is not one of these. But the  underlying idea of angle certainly is.
Although the students may have only a vague idea, or none at all, of the
meaning of the degree as a measure of an angle, they do have
an intuitive sense of the relative sizes of angles. Thus we can ask whether
working with turtles changes their intuitive notion of angle and their skill
in making judgments about angles. Several factors make this a severe
test. The longer a piece of knowledge has been in place the harder it is to
madify it and here we are asking whether an exposure of a few weeks to
turtles can affect knowldge that has been in place for mmany years. Moreover
intuitive knowledge is particularly resistant to modification through 
formal methods. Nevertheless we did obtain some very encouraging positive
results of which we report a sample in the next paragraphs.
