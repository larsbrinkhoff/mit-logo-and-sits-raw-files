14.  Deborah

0Deborah is considered to be a below average student by her teachers.
She has difficulty learning new topics, and is usually dependent on a
lot of help from her teachers.  She presents a good example of a
"slow learner."  Her most recent national achievement test scores place
her in the 28th percentile.

Deborah began by being extremely timid and dependent in interactions with the computer.  
It was not until the eighth class that she had enough confidence
to use the carriage return at the end of a line of instructions.
She experienced great difficulty with simple projects.
Starting at the 8th session, she was encouraged to "explore" with direct commands: FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT, LEFT, circles
and arcs.  She was able to gain confidence when exploring by limiting herself to 
very few commands and input numbers, which she repeated over and over.
By intuitively choosing input numbers which make very nice designs (90s
and 30s, for example), she was able to produce interesting effects.
Gradually she learned to write procedures, to teach the computer to draw the designs she liked.

By the end of the series of classes she had created some unusual designs which won praise from her classmates, had carried out (with some help) a major project requiring the use of planning and subprocedures, and had a strong confidence in her ability to use the computer.  She had invited both of her parents to visit the class, and they remarked
to the LOGO teacher that this was the first time that Deborah had been excited about anything in school.
Deborah's classroom teachers report that she has also become more assertive in class, has asked for extra help after school, etc.

11.  Deborah's Working Style

0The key to Deborah's success was her strategy of working with the computers.
Deborah was able to slowly build her confidence and understanding by
limiting her choices of LOGO commands and inputs, limiting the goals of
her work, and by working in a way that minimized the chances of error.
It was as if Deborah invented an unstated set of "rules" governing her
work in LOGO which helped her to be successful.

.indent 6
--she used a severely limited number of commands:  FORWARD, RIGHT,
LEFT, RARC, and LARC;

--she limited the inputs she used with these commands to 
multiples of 10, up to 100.  If a larger effect was needed, she would
use additional steps, as in FD 90, FD 30.  In fact, Deborah began by using
only inputs of 30, and gradually expanded to include other numbers,
while continuing to use 30, 60 and 90 as her favorites.

--her patience in a one-step-at-a-time mode of operation was quite
remarkable.  Her format was quite stereotyped.  (1) carry out one
turtle step (turn, move or penup); (2) check to see if that looks right
on the screen; (3) if so, write down the step and continue; (4) if not,
clear the screen, retype all the steps previously written down and try
another choice for the questionable one.

--she rejected all suggestions that she incorporate new ideas into her
work until she had thoroughly mastered the ideas with which she was
already familiar.

.indent 0
In short, she created a very limited "microworld" of computer
activities in which she could function successfully.  She gradually
expanded her microworld as she became confident of her mastery of the
concepts that she had already used.

On the other hand, the microworld which Deborah chose for herself,
the world of FORWARD 30 RIGHT 30, is very nearly as rich as all of
Turtle Geometry.  It includes Squares, triangles, circles, "stars", "men",
"rabbits", and a variety of abstract designs, as well as the
mathematical concepts of perpendicularity, inverse operations, the
Total Turtle Trip theorem, symmetry, similarity, estimation of lengths
and angles, planning and debugging, and procedure writing.
By repeating rotations of RIGHT 30, it is possible to turn the TURTLE 60, 90, 120,
180 or 360 degrees.  Thus, Deborah could make a square, make the TURTLE
reverse direction, and make simple symmetrical designs by using only 30
as an input to RIGHT and LEFT.  Similarly, designs based on
lengths of 30 TURTLE steps, fit nicely into larger units of 90 or 120
(30 + 90) turtle steps.

.he2
Dependency Phase
By limiting her inputs to numbers such as 30, 60 and 90, Deborah
actually enhanced the possibility that her explorations would
produce interesting results.  We do
not know why Deborah chose these numbers for her initial explorations,
rather than numbers like 55, and 66, or 34, 45, and 56, that are often
chosen
initially by many other children.  Deborah never appeared
to calculate consciously that "three thirties make ninety," or
that "three sixties makes the TURTLE reverse direction".  Throughout
her work she was unwilling to combine inputs, and never used an input
greater than 100.

Deborah's work during the LOGO classes fell into three major phases:  a
period of severe dependence and insecurity; a period of exploration,
creation of different designs and the gradual understanding of aspects
of Turtle Geometry and LOGO programming; and a period of consolidating
her learning by working on a major project which took her several class
periods to complete.  These three phases will now be examined in some
detail.

.block 5
12.  Dependence and Insecurity0

For the first seven classes, Deborah worked on "teaching the computer"
to draw
her initials.  She had a strong need to have every detail of her work be
"correct," and she seemed to be afraid of making mistakes.  As a
result, she needed reassurance from the teacher for everything she did,
and was unsure of even the simplest details -- such as typing a
carriage return at the end of every line.  She was reluctant to write
in her notebook, and easily lost track of what she had done successfully.

.he2
Exploratory Phase
During this period she would wait patiently for the teacher's help,
starting off silently into space for long periods of time, if he was
busy elsewhere.  She had good insights about where
to move the turtle to produce the initials she was drawing and she had
difficulty understanding how to translate those insights into LOGO
commands.  Although the project of drawing initials is an excellent
introductory LOGO project for many children, it seemed too complex for
Deborah.  It clearly had a "correct" result, which Deborah needed to
achieve.  She would not allow herself to experiment or to try out
something that might not prove to be "right".

During this period, however, she did develop some knowledge that she
could use later on.  While making the turtle draw the "M" for her last
initial, she discovered that she could orient the turtle correctly at
each vertex by repeating turns of RIGHT or LEFT 30.  She was exposed to
the idea of a procedure, although she was not yet able to write one
independently.  She began to develop some facility with the keyboard.
When her initials were finally complete, Deborah had a feeling of pride
and "ownership," despite the large amount of assistance she had
required to carry out the project. (See Figure 4.1)

.block 5
13. Exploration, and the Gradual Buildup of Skills and Confidence0

Realizing that the initials project had brought out the most compulsive
and insecure aspects of Deborah's personality, the teacher suggested a
different approach, as soon as the project was finished.  He "assigned"
Deborah the task of "experimenting" with FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT and LEFT
commands and the procedures RARC, LARC, RCIRCLE and LCIRCLE.  Although
Deborah
was told to use a variety of inputs with these commands,  during her
first period of exploration, she only used two inputs: 30 and 90.
She used 90 as an input for the RARC procedure, and used 30's for all
other TURTLE commands.

Once Deborah got into "experimenting" mode, the compulsive need for success was 
eliminated, and she began to feel successful "without really trying".  Deborah brought her copying skills into play, and developed a good way of writing procedures.  Once she had a design she liked, she would look at the terminal, to find the last
CLEARSCREEN command on the screen.  Then she would copy into her notebook, all the 
steps following the CLEARSCREEN.  If she had mistakenly used a LEFT 30, followed by a 
RIGHT 30 to correct it, she copied both, choosing to exercise no judgement as she copied.  
She was shown how to put a title at the top of the list of steps in her
notebook, number each line, put the command END at the bottom, 
and type the entire procedure on the terminal. 

Sometimes Deborah made mistakes in copying.  When she did, she had two ways of 
correcting them:  first she checked that the steps on the screen were copied correctly in her book;
second, she checked that the steps in her book were copied correctly in a procedure.  
Her most common error was leaving out line numbers when typing her procedure.
She could correct this herself, however, by retyping as much of the procedure as necessary.  (She
continued to increment line numbers by ones, until near the end of the classes.)  When Deborah made a mistake, she would say "I goofed," in a wistful voice, and ask for help or reassurance.
As she gradually came to realize that she had ways of fixing "goofs" by herself, she
began to need help less and less.

Deborah also used the word "goof" in another context.  When she was exploring freely, she would say "I'm just goofing around."
There must have been an unstated connection in her mind between the two uses of "goof".

The approach used in teaching Deborah during this phase of her work was to show her 
no more than necessary to help her accomplish her purposes.
She was shown EDIT (ED) and PRINTOUT (PO) to help 
with editing, and very little else for a long time.
She needed to feel in control, and since she was carefully limiting the choices 
available to her,
the teacher did the same.  
When an opportunity occured to show her something new, the teacher made
limited suggestions, which she
was encouraged to accept or reject.
Deborah repeated successful activities over and over again until she was really secure with them, and ready to extend her "microworld".  
She had control of whether to accept or reject suggestions, and
gradually became able to accept them when she felt they were appropriate.

During this exploratory phase which lasted for seven or eight class
sessions, Deborah created a number of interesting designs.  SPYRO (see
figure 4.2) was her first independently initiated procedure.  It grew
out of exploratory work with the RARC subprocedure -- repeating RARC
and increasing the input by 10.

Deborah's first use of a subprocedure as a "building block" came after
she had made a CIRCLE procedure using four RARC 90s.  Deborah made a FLOWER
procedure by repeating a circle and a rotation.  Deborah chose
RIGHT 60 for the rotation, which led to a figure which closed after six
repeats and made a symmetrical design (figure 4.4).

Drawing a Star
Deborah's most spectacular design was developed after the whole class 
watched a film which showed a number of computer designs.  Among the designs 
shown was a six pointed star.
When Deborah came right back to class from the film, she drew a six pointed star with the computer, without making a single mistake.  She began by turning the TURTLE 
RIGHT 30, and proceeded to draw the star by using a combination of FORWARD 70s, and 
RIGHT 60s.  Her choice of RIGHT 30 for the first step, and RIGHT 60 for the turns
was critical in allowing her to carry out the project easily.  Her strategy was to 
move the TURTLE forward 70 turtle steps, and then repeat RIGHT 60 until the 
TURTLE was aimed in the 
right direction.  The total rotations needed are RIGHT 120 at the
points of the star, and RIGHT 300 (equivalent to LEFT 60) at the inner 
vertices.  
Deborah did not
seem to realize that she was always repeating RIGHT 60 two times and five times.  At each point, she just kept turning the 
TURTLE until it was pointed in the right direction.  At one point, Deborah missed the correct direction, and continued repeating RIGHT 60 for a total of 11 times until the correct orientation was
achieved (Figure 4.5).

.block 20
.sp 18

Figure 4.5

The teacher suggested an "easier" way for Deborah to teach the computer how to make the star.
He suggested that Deborah teach the computer how to make one point, and then repeat that to make the star.  Deborah accepted the suggestion, and taught the computer:

Since TRYANGLE included the step, RIGHT 30, it did not work when it was 
used as a subprocedure.  Deborah noticed this when she tried to use it.
The teacher helped her remove the extra step, and reminded her to use RIGHT
30 as the first step in her STAR procedure.

After Deborah had drawn the first TRYANGLE correctly, she was asked what command she had to give the TURTLE next.  She looked at the situation carefully and after some time, said, 
"LEFT 60!"   She then tried it and found that it worked.  After 
that, she was able to build the star by
repeating TRYANGLE, LEFT 60 until 6 points were constructed.  Here is
her procedure, STAR, and the revised subprocedure, TRYANGLE:

During this exploratory phase Deborah gained a great deal of the
knowledge and confidence that seemed so difficult for her to obtain
while trying to make the computer draw her initials.  She learned to
control the TURTLE, to write procedures and to use procedures as
subprocedures in a "building-block" fashion.  At the same time she
learned to interpret error messages, correct her work, and to debug
her procedures.  Most important, she developed the confidence with the
keyboard and the computer, that would enable her to carry out a major project.

Drawing a Rabbit

14. Deborah's Major Project -- Drawing a Rabbit Head0

In the sixteenth class session, Deborah indicated that she was
ready to tackle a major project.  She made a drawing of a rabbit (see
figure 4.6a), and immediately said "It's too hard."  A modification
was suggested by the teacher using a square head, and triangular ears,
that might be easier for her to carry out.  (See figure 4.6b).

Figure 4.7


.adjust
Deborah began drawing on the rabbit using direct
commands.  She built a square using turtle steps of 70 and 60 to make a side of length
130, and repeated FORWARD 70, FORWARD 60, for each side of the square.  She then moved
up the side of the square to make the eyes.  When she got confused, she
cleared the screen and tried again.  When she hit a snag again, she
cleared the screen again, and temporarily went on to another project -- rotating
her FLOWER design and repeating it.

When Deborah came back to the rabbit project a few days later, she chose FORWARD 90, 
FORWARD 30, as the commands to make each
side of her square.  After several more attempts to make the computer 
draw the eyes and the nose,
the teacher suggested breaking the problem into parts, and teaching each part to the computer separately.  Deborah agreed to
this and
decided to teach the computer to draw the outside of the rabbit first.  She could not think of a name for this, and finally decided to call it
"HAT" (See figure 4.7a)

In the next session, Deborah added the eyes to the head, calling her procedure 
LITTLEEYES.  When she began to teach LITTLEEYES to the computer, she 
intended to include, all the steps following CLEARSCREEN, as usual.  
The teacher explained that HAT and LITTLEEYES were both part of RABBIT, but that HAT should not be part of LITTLEEYES.

Her strategy of using 30 as an input helped her locate the eyes
sucessfully in the head.
The sides of the head were now 120 units long, and since she moved the TURTLE across the head in steps of 
30 units, she was able to center the eyes with no difficulty.  (See figure, 4.7b)

When Deborah began to work on the nose, she got really stuck.  She had two
different problems to resolve:  How to make the nose, and where to put it.
The teacher showed her how to separate the two problems, and make the nose all by itself -- forgetting about the rest of the rabbit for the time being.  Then, once a good nose had been made, she could work on placing the nose in the right position.

.he2
What Deborah Learned
Deborah planned to make the nose as shown in figure 4.6.   The teacher
showed her how
to start with RARC, turn the TURTLE all the way around, come back to the beginning using LARC, and then reverse the
whole process to make the other side.  Deborah understood the idea, but needed help working it out.  
Whenever Deborah needed to turn the TURTLE around she used RIGHT 90, 
RIGHT 90. (See figure, 4.7c)

Later, when she began to make the rabbit's ear, she again demonstrated her accuracy 
in choice of inputs.  She had moved the TURTLE to the top of the rabbit's head.  
Deborah needed three tries to make the first ear.  The key decision was how far 
to turn at the top.  Since she had turned the TURTLE
RIGHT 20 at the base of the ear, a turn of RIGHT 140 was needed to make an 
isoceles triangle.  
In Deborah's first try, she turned RIGHT 90 four times, then RIGHT 90, RIGHT 30, 
RIGHT 30, for a total of 150 degrees.  
The far end of the ear did not line up easily with the top of the head.  Her second try was
RIGHT 900 (mistake), followed by two RIGHT 90s, to straighten the TURTLE 
out again, followed by RIGHT 70, RIGHT 20, RIGHT 20, RIGHT 20, RIGHT 20, for a 
net rotation of 150 degrees again.  Once again, she had trouble lining up the far end.  On 
the third try, she turned RIGHT 90, 
RIGHT 30, RIGHT 20, for a total rotation of 140 degrees.
This made it easy to line up the far end of the ear, which happened to come out almost exactly at the far end of the head.  At this point, Deborah wrote out all the steps, and said "I can do the same thing on the other side.  Should I give
this a name?" (See figure 4.7d).  She then defined the procedure TO EARS.

At the next session, Deborah was helped to separate the steps that made the ear, from the steps that set it in position.
By doing so, she could use the same subprocedure, EARS, to make ears on both sides.  
Her completed RABBIT is shown in figure 4.7.

At one point, while working on the ears, Deborah rejected help from the teacher, asserting
her independence by proclaiming loudly, "I know what I'm doing!"  

.epage 1
During the RABBIT project
Deborah mastered some aspects of LOGO and used other concepts that she
had not yet mastered.  Some of Deborah's learnings were:

.indent 6
--first and foremost -- the idea of using subprocedures to break a large 
project into a group of small projects.

--that a subprocedure can have two parts, drawing the object (nose, ear) and locating it, and that the same subprocedure (EARS) can be used in more than one place.

--that with patience, even complicated problems can be worked out by step by
step using a trial and error approach (location of nose, location and shape of ears)_

--that 90, 30 and 20 are really good numbers to use in combinations (In her entire RABBIT procedure Deborah used a total of 75 procedural steps.
Forty-nine out of fifty-eight TURTLE commands used inputs of 90, 30 or
20.)

--for the first time, she developed complete confidence in her ability to understand what she was doing ("I know what I'm doing!")
while recovering from the frequent errors she made.  Perhaps this was really the most important learning for Deborah -- not just to be in control of a learning environment, but to know she was in control, to feel a sense of
mastery.  To be able to learn from and not be daunted by her own mistakes.

.he2
Rabbit Procedures
.indent 0
With the completion of her rabbit project, Deborah had almost totally
reversed her initial feelings of dependence and incompetence.  She
invited her parents, teachers and school principal to visit the
computer lab, and in many ways, demonstrated to her visitors and
classmates her new found sense of confidence, satisfaction and power.
