1. We showed her the turtle, keyboard (buttonbox) and asked her to
move the turtle but she did not do anything.

2. Her mother came and the session was interupted because the teachers
came to talk to Annette and her mother.

Class #2.....April 06

1. We asked her to move the turtle.  She would not do anything.  We showed
her how to do it but she was not interested in it.

2.  Then we switched to the turtle on the screen and made the turtle to
move using regular LOGO commands.  We made some drawings on the screen
then cleared it and let Annette work by herself.

3. As we were talking at the other side of the room she typed on the
keyboard 4 letters always typing and looking at the screentc.  She typed:  WERT

Class #3

1. We used the program where the turtle and the screen respond with the
same behavior when the keys of the same line of keys are pushed:
.block 5
.sp 3
.ce
Figure

2. We left her alone and stood at the other side of the room and we
noticed her activity.

3. We left the room and she pusshed several keys and got some pictures
on the screen.

4. The system crashed and when we brought the system back again she
would not participate.  We tried for 10-15 minutes alternating: sitting
with her/leaving the room.
