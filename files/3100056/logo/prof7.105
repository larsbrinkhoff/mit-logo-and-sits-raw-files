Working Style

17. Gary

Gary is considered to be "extremely bright" by his teachers.
On his sixth grade school
achievement tests his overall score placed him in the 83rd percentile.
His teachers report that they find it difficult to
find ways to challenge him within his regular school program, while at
the same time reporting "peculiar gaps" in his academic knowledge -- in
the area of standard arithmetical skills, for example.

Gary found LOGO to be an exciting challenge.  He worked on four major
projects each of which led to significant new learning in different
areas:  using arcs and circles to draw a face; creating a simple math
quiz; drawing and animating a starship; and writing a computer program
capable of "understanding" Morse Code.  During the course of his work,
Gary mastered the use of recursion and variables in a number of
different contexts; he understood the use of conditionals and
"branching"; he learned to write state transparent procedures, and to
use superprocedures with modular subprocedures.  
In his last project he was beginning to
make use of recursion in list and word processing, 
and learned the concepts of "empty list" and "empty word".

The teaching strategy used with Gary was to offer him simple models of
a particular kind of procedure, give him the information he needed, and
leave him alone to elaborate on the model, providing help only when
asked.  When one phase of a project was finished, additional challenges were
suggested occasionally he was asked to
alter or improve his work.  In this way, Gary was able to move ahead on
his own, at as fast a rate as he wanted.

11. Gary's Working Style

0Of all our experimental subjects, Gary, who had had some prior
exposure to computers, seemed the most predisposed
to success in LOGO.  He combined a strong interest in computers
with a learning style that encompassed both analytical and
trial-and-error approaches.
He absorbed new ideas voraciously, and rarely had to
be shown something twice.  He tackled extremely ambitious projects, and
always stayed with a project until some kind of completion was achieved.

0Gary's work demonstrated some clear characteristics that set him
apart from most of the other students:
Gary easily understood the use of a procedure as an entity, recognizing
the usefulness of naming a series of steps, and thereafter considering
them as a "unit"; he often wrote procedures without trying out the
steps individually first, recognizing that the series of steps could be
considered to have a "total effect," as though it were a single command.

Gary had faith in his ability to solve problems by reasoning as well
as trial-and-error.  He was constantly trying things out "in his head",
making use of a number of "abstract principles" to simplify and debug
his work as he went along.  A series of FORWARD and BACK commands would
easily be combined into one command.  Left/right reversibility would be
used to correct an error.  At one point, for example, Gary had typed
RIGHT 99, and realized from the effect that he should have used LEFT 99.  He
then used the computer to add 99 + 99, and typed LEFT 198.  In writing
his procedure later, he simply used the correct command LEFT 99,
without ever having tried it explicitly.

Gary tended to "plunge into a problem" impetuously, with very little
advance planning, drawing on a quick analysis, based on partially
understood ideas.  He then enjoyed the process of debugging his
original idea, or of moving in a new direction, if his result was
significantly different from what he had intended.  In the first class,
Gary noticed that repeating a simple three step procedure made a
"pattern" that looked something like a "circle".  When another student
suggested making a smaller circle inside the first one, Gary
started a small investigation of curvature.  He began to
make a new circle by using the same procedure with smaller inputs.
When his new circle came out larger than the original one, Gary was
surprised and delighted.
He then tested another approach -- make all
the inputs exactly half of the original, which led to a "circle" of
almost the same size as his first one.  And so on, until he had tried
many variations.

Gary: Drawing a Face
Gary usually worked in a step-by-step fashion, rather than
plan his work in advance.
While he generally had an overall idea of what he was
trying to do, he tended to incorporate subprocedures one after another,
rather than to break down his problem into parts and plan his
subprocedures in advance.  He showed that he was capable of using a
more structured approach.  When he was asked by his teacher to rewrite
his STARSHIP procedure, he created a set of simple modular
subprocedures to draw the starship.

Gary often sought out bugs, testing for extreme situations:  the
largest possible inputs, the largest number of REPEATs, situations
which would produce error messages, as a way of understanding both the
capabilities and limitations of the computer, beyond the needs of any
specific project on which he was working.

Gary's work was goal-directed and ambitious.  During his seven weeks of
LOGO classes  he
worked on four major projects.
While he enjoyed brief detours, such as the "circle" exploration
described above, his work was usually directed quite specifically at
his particular immediate goal.  Between projects, he often appeared to be
restless; once a new task was selected, he was off and running again.

Drawing a Face
.block 5
12. Gary's FACE Project

0Gary's first project was to draw a complicated "face"
built from a large number of subprocedures.
The project involved learning to use superprocedures,
subprocedures, and a great deal of Turtle Geometry.
Gary used functional procedure names,
abbreviated procedure names, and "nonsense" names, all in a rather
elaborate scheme to "hide" the sub-procedures which actually "did the
job". 
This complex hierarchy of subprocedures was
extremely difficult for Gary himself to debug, and he often had to
trace through the entire "tree structure" of his project to find a
bug in a particular procedure.

In carrying out his FACE project Gary quickly developed a facility with
Turtle Geometry:  basic TURTLE commands; RIGHT/LEFT reversibility;
mastery of 90 degree angles; the geometry of arcs and circles; and the
use of an implied axis of symmetry.  Although his design was
symmetrical, it was not constructed by simply reversing RIGHT/LEFT
commands to make it symmetrical about its center.  Gary's
more complex method involved
working "from the outside, in."  To draw the
eyes, for instance, Gary moved the TURTLE to the outside of the
right-hand circle and drew the circle.  Then he calculated the distance
of two diameters, moved the TURTLE to the outside of the left-hand
circle, and drew that circle.  (See Figure 7.1, and Gary's procedure, FOO6).

Making a Math Quiz

13. Gary's Math Quiz

0Gary's second project
involved the use of conditionals,
PRINT statements, the naming of variables, and random numbers to create
a "math quiz" which gave a user a series of two-digit addition problems.
Although he planned to extend the project to include subtraction,
multiplication and division, he decided to go on to other activities
after completing the addition portion of the quiz.
During the following year, Gary went back to this project and completed
it, making use of LOGO computer provided by his school system.

While working on the math quiz Gary encountered an interesting bug
which was typical of the kinds of problems that often resulted from
Gary's working style.  Gary would
plunge into a problem
"headfirst", with very little planning or consideration for the effects
of an action that might go beyond his focus of the moment.  In making
his math quiz, he originally had a set of procedures named MATH, MATH1,
MATH3.  He decided that they were ordered incorrectly, 
and so decided
to EDIT the titles of the procedures, so that 
the superprocedure would be called MATH, the first subprocedure
would be MATH1, the second, MATH2, etc.  What he forgot while doing
this, was that he would also have to change all the procedures
themselves, so that they would be calling the correct subprocedures.
When he finished changing the names around, all his procedures suddenly
stopped working.  He was able to debug this situation himself by
printing out his procedures and "playing computer".

Drawing a Starship
.block 5
14. Gary's Starship Project

0Gary's third major project was the drawing and animation of a
starship (Figure 7.3).  At first he constructed a long, involved
step-by-step procedure, which required some involved, rather
frustrating debugging.  Gary's debugging resulted in the addition
of even more lines to his one basic procedure.

Although Gary successfully debugged the
procedure, his teacher suggested that he redo the entire
project, making use of simple procedures and subprocedures.  This time,
having experienced both extremes -- an unnecessarily complex hierarchy
of subprocedures in his FACE project, and an unnecessarily long single
procedure for his STARSHIP, Gary constructed a set of modular
subprocedures to draw the starship:

A Morse Code Translator
.adjust
.block 5
15. Gary's Morse Code Project

0For his last project, Gary decided to create a Morse Code Translator as
the first step of a project to actually transmit morse code over radio
waves, which he had read about in a computer hobbyist magazine.  In
creating the Morse Code translator he made
use of FIRST and BUTFIRST comands in connection with list
and word processing; his recursive procedures used
the concepts of "empty word" and "empty list" in their STOP rules; and
he used  conditional statements to decide which particular set of Morse
Code symbols to output.  

The morse code translator was built up by first creating a lengthy
procedure, CODE, which output the correct sequence of dots and dashes
for any letter or number:
.nofill

.block 6
TO CODE :LETTER
10 IF :LETTER = "A OUTPUT ".-
20 IF :LETTER = "B OUTPUT "-...
30...
END

.adjust
The procedure PRI: WORD prints the correct sequence of letters for an
entire word:

.nofill
.BLOCK 6
TO PRI :WORD 
10 IF :WORD = " STOP 
20 TYPE CODE FIRST :WORD 
30 TYPE "/ 
40 PRI BUTFIRST :WORD 
END

PRI "HELLO

 ..././.-../.-../---/
.adjust

The procedure PR12 :SENT, prints the correct sequence of letters for an
entire sentence:

.nofill
.BLOCK 6 
TO PRI2 :SENT
10 IF :SENT = [ ] STOP
20 PRI FIRST :SENTENCE
30 TYPE "
40 PRI2 BUTFIRST :SENT
END

PRI2 [HELLO HOW ARE YOU]

 .../.-../.-../.../---/.--/.-/.-././-.---/---/..-/

.adjust
In creating these procedures Gary had to understand the difference
between words and lists, and how this effected the wording of the stop
rules in PRI (which manipulated words) and in PRI2 (which manipulated
lists of words).  He also had to carry out a process of trial and error
to determine the location of the stop rule in each procedure.  When the
series of LOGO classes ended, Gary was engaged in the process of
reversing the code -- that is, writing a set of procedures which would
take a string of Morse Code symbols as input, and print out an English
sentence.

Conclusions
.block 5
16 Conclusions

0Gary absorbed a great deal in approximately 25 hours of LOGO
classes.  His projects involved a number of different content areas:
Turtle Geometry, interactive programming, animation, list processing,
etc.  His enthusiasm remained at a fever pitch throughout the series of
classes.  Gary actively resisted leaving class each day and
when the cycle of LOGO classes was finished, Gary helped
establish an after school "computer club," so that he could carry on
his work.

The computer activities provided the kind of challenge and the scope of
intellectual activities that Gary wanted and needed to develop his
abilities most fully.  The fact that this challenge and
scope was not always present his regular classes was attested to
frequently by his classroom teachers.  A LOGO capability in a
classroom could help teachers meet the needs of students
like Gary.
