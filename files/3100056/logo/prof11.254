111. Kathy

0Kathy, a student who was new to the school this year, is considered
to be an "above average" student.  (Her most recent school administered
achievement tests place her in the 60th percentile overall.)  She is
cheerful, confident, and enjoys "playing" with words and ideas.

From the very beginning of the classes, Kathy displayed a quiet confidence, and competance in using the computer.  Although not very assertive in the early group sessions, she seemed to have an excellent understanding of basics right from the start.

11. Kathy's Working Style

Kathy was a student with a subtle sense of humor who derived a great
deal of intellectual pleasure from her work.  She usually worked in an
explorational mode, or in the context of short tasks, either self
defined or suggested by a teacher.  When difficulties were encountered,
she preferred to resolve them on her own, although without a great deal
of persistence.  When she did ask for help, she was accepting of the
teacher's suggestions, and readily learned new ideas in the context of
the projects in which she was engaged.

Kathy carried out dozens of small projects in the course of her LOGO
experience.  She shifted back and forth between open ended explorations
and small goal directed projects.  Her favorite activity was to repeat
and combine existing procedures to produce new unexpected results.
Often she would interrupt an exploration to pursue a particular idea
which had been suggested to her by the designs she had just created.

One of the ways in which Kathy structured her work was in her choice of
procedure names.  Her procedure names often indicated the relationship
between a new procedure, and the subprocedures from which it had been
built.  Thus, a symmetrical design was called BARN because it was built
by repeating a subprocedure called HORSE.   A procedure called WORMY
was made by doubling all the sizes in a similar design called WORM.
And, in a rare example of top-down naming, a procedure called MONSTER
was made up of subprocedures MO, NS, and TER.

Kathy was extremely comfortable, with giving and receiving help.  She often helped other children with the use of disks, particular elements of the LOGO language, ideas for projects, etc.  She was also quite willing to ask for help when she needed it, both from the teacher and from classmates, especially
Monica with whom she worked a good deal.  
In this way, Kathy was able to make steady progress in her understanding of LOGO, in her ability to conceive and carry out projects and in problem solving skills.

Kathy enjoyed working with concepts, rather than simply with practical results. Kathy was the only student among the first eight to persevere in making the computer draw a circle.  We spent a lot of time, talking and playing turtle, until Kathy understood that she could make a circle by repeating
FORWARD 20, RIGHT 20, over and over again.  She rejected the idea of accomplishing this with recursion (although it would have been quicker), because 
she was trying to follow through with her own idea of repeating each step, step by step.  She did accept the idea of combining several of the steps into a subprocedure, and then repeating the subprocedure to make a circle.  When her final result, SHELL, eventually had too many steps, and went on past the closing point of the circle, she was satisfied with it.  She knew that she could have modified her circle to make it close exactly.  What she had been concerned with was whether the circle would close at all.  When it did, she was satisfied that she had solved her problem.

5 FORWARD 20		END
6 RIGHT 20
7 FORWARD 20
8 RIGHT 20
9 FORWARD 20
10 RIGHT 20
END

.adjust
This is typical of Kathy's approach.  She developed a concept of what she wanted to do.  She asked for help when she felt she needed it.  She listened to the various suggestions, and selected from them the ones she wanted to follow, in accordance with her own understanding of what the problem was about.  Whatever approaches she used in her problem solving, she learned.  While she often asked for help, she did not need to ask for help in those areas again.

Kathy was comfortable initating ideas for projects, and borrowing them from others -- even copying procedures directly from a booklet or bulletin board.  She quickly learned that direct copying often led to unexpected problems, and she became more careful with her borrowing.

Kathy and Monica worked together a great deal. (See profile #14, Monica.)  
Both of them were interested in small, short-term projects, with visually pleasing results.  Both depended on their mutual sharing as a source of ideas, help and reassurance.  Although they often worked on the same tasks, they usually worked separately.  Their approaches, and results, were different.  Kathy's favorite activity was making a procedure and repeating it.  Monica's was repeating a procedure and putting a rotation after each repeat. For example, Kathy borrowed a procedure of Marilyn's called HORSE in which the computer repeated the instructions, BOX, 
RIGHT 20, five times.  Kathy changed and elaborated it as follows:

.nofill
.indent 6
.block 10
TO HORSE
1 BOX
2 RT 70
3 BOX
4 RT 70
5 BOX
6 RT 70
7 BOX
8 RT 70
END
.indent 0

and she repeated it, using:

.indent 6
.block 7
TO BARN 
1 HORSE
2 HORSE
3 HORSE
4 HORSE
5 HORSE
END

.indent 0
.adjust
Kathy made BARN, after repeating HORSE several times by direct command and deciding that she wanted to repeat HORSE exactly 5 times.  Although she could have used recursion, she chose to limit her repeats to exactly five.  She also called her new procedure BARN, introducing the mnemonic device "a barn is a group of horses."  Once again, Kathy was "in charge" of what happened, using the cliche idea, "repeat a procedure over and over," but keeping control of both the process and the end result.

Thus when Kathy and Monica worked on similar tasks, each child brought her own specific knowledge, experience and "bag of tricks" to the project; and came out with a result that made her feel successful.  Looked at in detail, we see that the girls actually functioned quite differently, and what each of them learned from the project was probably quite different.
There does not seem to have been
any great significance to the choice of angle (20 degrees for Monica and 70 degrees for Kathy).  Both were simply using a number that had worked out well before.  Kathy's 70 may have been just a mis-copying of Monica's 20.

12. Some Examples of Kathy's Work

0Kathy's approach to her work is exemplified by a series of small
projects which made use of a BOX and a TRIANGLE procedure as
fundamental building blocks.  The BOX and TRIANGLE procedures
were constructed during periods of careful, goal-directed
explorations.

Box was the first procedure completed by Kathy and her group, and they
immediately followed by constructing a series of figures making use of
BOX as a subprocedure.  (See examples in Part II, Chapter 5. section 1.3.2).
It was quite natural for her to repeat TRIANGLE as well.  She was
pleased with the result, calling it BUTTERFLY.  She then repeated
BUTTERFLY six times until the figure "closed".  This new design she
called 7BUTTERFLY (reflecting an initial miscount of how many repeats
of the BUTTERFLY procedure she had used).

Following her initial exploration with triangles, Kathy's teacher
suggested that she put her TRIANGLE and BOX procedures together to make
a "house".  After some goal-directed exploration, the HOUSE procedure
resulted.  Kathy immediately repeated HOUSE four times (calling this
new procedure HOUSE4) until the design
closed.  Next she wanted to see how her HOUSE4 design and 7BUTTERFLY
would go together.  She named the result HB47, indicating its
relationship to HOUSE4 and 7BUTTERFLY.

Kathy: Drawing a Spider

This set of projects culminated when Kathy declared that HB47 "looks
like a spider," and returned to goal-directed activity, adding a series
of circles to the design, to produce the procedure SPI.

Although Kathy had constructed HB47 and its subprocedures by repeating
simple shapes over and over to make a symmetrical design, she was also
able to make explicit use of both right/left symmetry and similarity of
shape in the process of constructing her "spider".  It was this
combination of more or less random explorations 
involving existing procedures, with expert use of heuristics such
as similarity and symmetry when working in a goal-directed manner, that
most commonly characterized Kathy's work.

.epage 1
When Kathy repeated her borrowed XMASTREE procedure, she found that many repeats made a lovely, complex design.  Here she used
recursion, since she was not concerned about how many times the procedure was repeated in all.

Later in the series of classes Kathy did a lot of 
exploration with arcs and circles, and began to work on some longer projects.  
One day she decided that a series of arcs "looks like a 
worm," and wrote the procedures WORM and WORMY (in which WORMY is exactly twice the size of WORM).  (Figure 11.9)

Debugging a Monster
In a later experiment, which made use of symmetry in an unusual way, Kathy 
created an exotic looking "Monster."  (See Figure 11.10).

.block 21
.sp 19
.ce
Figure 11.10

When she decided to teach MONSTER to the computer, the 
teacher suggested that she break up the project into parts.  
She isolated three parts, and decided to name them MO, NS, and TER, so that her procedure MONSTER would be:

.block 6
.nofill
TO MONSTER
1 MO
2 NS
3TER
END

and the subprocedures were:

.block 8  
TO MO		TO NS		TO TER
1 RARC 40	1 LARC 40	1 RARC 40
2 RARC 20	2 LARC 20	2 RARC 20

5 LCIRCLE 20	5 RCIRCLE 20	5 RCIRCLE 20
6 RCIRCLE 20	6 LCIRCLE 20	6 LCIRCLE 20
END		END		END

.adjust
Kathy may have realized that MO and TER were identical, but 
in any case, she wanted to have TER 
as a distinct procedure to follow through on her naming scheme.  
Now, when Kathy typed MONSTER, the result was.

.block 18
.sp 16
.ce
Figure 11.11

Kathy had forgotten to include the interface steps between the three procedures, so that when she ran 
the procedure MONSTER, the result was quite discouraging.
When asked for help in debugging the teacher suggested running 
MO, NS and TER separately.  When Kathy did so, she could see that the intermediate steps had been left out.  
Her teacher helped her to work out what 
these steps should be, and in its final incarnation, MONSTER became:

.block 10

END

.adjust
Kathy's last project, carried out during classes 21 and 22, also involved symmetrical arcs, and also required a good deal of debugging.  In this case, Kathy had tried out a long sequence of direct commands, and made a mistake or two in copying them into her notebook.  When her procedure turned out to be buggy, she had to spend a lot of time stepping through it, in order to figure out which steps were wrong, and how to fix them.  Since she had numbered all her steps by ones, she had to do a great deal of unnecessary retyping.  
At several points in her work it had been suggested to Kathy that she number steps by fives
or tens, but she had never felt 
a need to adopt that suggestion.  (In the class following this one, Kathy had a visitor, Renee, who was learning to write a procedure.  When Kathy taught her, she told her to number the steps by tens.  It seems that she got the point, however belatedly.)

Exploring Angles
.block 5
13. Exploring the Effects of Different Angles

0If Kathy's work had an area of weakness, it was in Turtle Geometry.
 Kathy had difficulty estimating angles right from the start, and
tended to stay away from projects that made it necessary for her to
work precisely with angle mnaipulations.  Although she and the teacher
had "talked through" the idea that "when the turtle goes all the way
around, it turns 360 degrees, as part of Kathy's circle project, this
became an idea that she "filed" away, and did not find much use for on
her own.

To help Kathy focus on the effects of using different angles, she was shown a
POLY :ANGLE procedure.
While she liked the designs that it made, she did not analyze the connection between the input number, and the shape that resulted.  In her first session experimenting with POLY, she used the inputs 88, 234, 12345, 300, 344, 90, 199, 125, and 888, 666, 555, and 77.  Although 
she used POLY again on several other occasions, she continued to choose inputs fairly randomly.

.block 14
.sp 12
.ce
Figure 11.12

During class 20, she was experimenting with her procedure WOW which drew a set of nested squares.  She was trying to rotate this to create a particular design, (figure 11.7) but 
could not determine the correct angle
despite several attempts.  To help her focus on the problem, she was
shown the procedure.

.block 6

.nofill

10 WOW
20 RIGHT :ANGLE
30 IF HEADING = 0 STOP
40 SPINWOW :ANGLE
END

.indent 0
.adjust
This was meant to serve as a vehicle for exploring angles, and for furthering her understanding of variables and STOP rules.

At first she chose inputs like 900, 9999, 777 and 666.  At the beginning of the next class, 
a discussion was held about "interesting angles," and she was reminded
that the TURTLE turns all the way around in 360 degrees.  
It was suggested that numbers that divided evenly into 360 degrees might be 
"interesting numbers" and that she spent the period experimenting with SPINWOW, and taking notes on the results.

.epage 1
Initially Kathy began using inputs that were factors of 360, like 4, 12, and 18, 60 and 90.  She quickly branched out to 100, 200, 400, etc.  Since she had been specifically asked to take notes on the results, she paid careful attention to what was happening, for the first time.  For example, she counted the number of "cones" that appeared in the designs, and this showed her that certain figures (SPINWOW 200  and SPINWOW 400) looked "the same".  Her notes, entitled "Interview with SPINWOW'S" are copied from her notebook (see Figure 11.13). (compare 
this with Monica's work with her procedure WISHWOW).

Kathy liked to initiate new projects, was comfortable with new ideas, and enjoyed the challenge of working on something to which the answer was not known in advance.  She accepted the existence of bugs - even coined the phrase "exterminating" to replace "debugging" -- and was willing to work to resolve them.  On the other hand, she usually chose to work on small projects, and to carefully limit the tools required for any task that she set herself.  This was her way of remaining in control of her work, making sure that her experience was not too confusing for her.

If Kathy
continued with LOGO classes, 
she could have worked on more projects using angles as variables, and
on at least one long term
project that required advanced planning and the use of subprocedures.  More work in these areas would have nicely rounded out her LOGO experience.
