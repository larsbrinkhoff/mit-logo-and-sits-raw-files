POSQ  outputs dotspot coordinates

TPOSQ  outputs tilespace coordinates

COLORQ outputs Turtle color

DCOLORQ outputs color of dotspot turtle is on

TCOLORQ outputs two-member list containing colors of
tilespace turtle is on.

Notice all the questions that can now be asked of a Turtle:

HEADINGQ

POSQ

TPOSQ

COLORQ

DCOLORQ

TCOLORQ

IN?
  

I suppose there should also be:

HEREQ  outputs list of 3 elements:  both dotspot coordinates
and the heading

THEREQ <??>  outputs list of both tilespace coordinates and
the heading
