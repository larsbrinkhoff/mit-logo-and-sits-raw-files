August 2  NOTES FROM CONVERSATION WITH KEN KAHN

1.  Problem of separate TILEPATTERN and TORTOISESHELL
commands:
Users should be able to design a pattern and then make it
either a shell, a tilepattern, or both.

2.  Creating Turtles:
Ken thinks turtles should be user-named from outset.
Question:  where do turtles appear if more than one is
called into existence at one time?

3.  Zones:  Syntax is
confusing.  Should be ZONE [0 0 ] 10 15, rather than ZONE [0
0 ][10 15] since this confuses coordinates of a corner with
dimensions.

4.  Dotspot/Tilespace commands:
Ken suggests switch of mode instead of double set of
commands.

5.  Coordinate system:
Coordinate system could be reset so as to use right-quadrant
system or four-quadrant system.

6.  Ways of designing shells/tiles:

     a.  Showing grid and using arrow keys;

     b.  Showing grid and using LOGO commands;

     c.  Writing procedures and using some command like
FILLIN that would take as input a list of the dotspot
numbers to be filled in with foreground color
