SOME ISSUES IN TI LOGO GRAPHICS

1.  Whether the default forward command, written FD, should
be forward by dotspots instead of having two separate
commands, FDD and FDT.

2.  Whether the turtle should come up in the middle of the
screen or at a corner.

3.  Whether the coordinate system should remain a four
quadrant system or should only be the top-right quadrant.

4.  Whether colors should be LOGO objects, i.e. should one
say

          TURTLE 1 COLOR RED

or

          TURTLE 1 COLOR "RED

                                ?

5.  Whether the more transparently logical TILEUP/TILEDOWN
noimenclature is to bew preferred to the more fantastic
TRAIL <or TRACK> /FLY nomenclature.

6.  Whether the linguistic distinction between words ending
in "Q" and words ending in "?" is useful and/or sound.
