SOME MORE IDEAS ON LOGO MUSIC

rhythm:

1.  Have key to tap out desired rhythm.  Default time
signature:  x/4.  Have durational values appear on screen,
perhaps both in notes and in numbers, where, e.g., 4 =
quarter note.

2.  Type of notes:  default could be portamento notes.
Rhythmic phrase could be ended by hitting a designated key.
Rests could be inserted by hitting another key.

pitch:

1.  Typewriter keyboard is basically bad news.  If, e.g.,
there were a sharps/flats convention where, e.g., terminal
keyboard a = musical middle C and tk w = m. C-sharp, a bias
in favor of tonal music would be built in.  If, on the other
hand, the chromatic scale were used, then there would not be
enough keys in a row to encompass an octave.

2.  Would be good to be able to connect to keyboards, both
traditional and those set up in such a way not to favor
tonal music.

Seems to me that LOGO music is very important and bears on
how LOGO is viewed generally.  That is to say, if LOGO music
is clearly not music, then this raises suspicion that LOGO
geometry is not geometry.
