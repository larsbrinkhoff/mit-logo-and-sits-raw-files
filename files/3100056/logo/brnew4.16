1A Partial Ordering of Student Behaviors With Regards To
.ce
Turtle Manipulation

0The ways in which students control the movements of the LOGO 
turtle is an important aspect of their behavior in the LOGO learning
environment.  
In this section, we shall describe the range of student behaviors in
the "learning environment" of "Turtle Geometry", and relate these
behaviors to fundamental understandings in mathematics.

We have organized our observations into six general categories:

1. Acquiring the sense of command.
2. Qualitative structuring of the number worlds.
3. Quantitative structuring of the number worlds.
4. The "group properties" of the number worlds -- structuring
   of mathematical operations.
5. The use of coordinate systems -- the "global structure" of the
   geometric world.
6. Theorems and heuristics -- movement towards formal mathematics.

As we shall see from the summaries of student behaviors that follow in
chapters 5 and 6, we did not observe all of these behaviors in all students.
Furthermore, different aspects of thse behaviors were usually combined
in a particular problem domain in which a student was working.  In
setting up these categories, we are simplifying the
complexity and interrelatedness of the actual learning environment
in order to isolate the particular skills that the students learned.
Their learning may have been more complex than we are
indicating here.

11. Acquiring the Sense of Command
.br
0Although the idea of "command" may seem quite obvious to an adult
computer scientist, a beginning student may require some time to
develop a purposeful sense of deliberately controlling the turtle by
particular commands.  As one might expect, most students develop a sense of
command after some degree of initial
contact with a computer.  Sometimes a student who has developed a sense
of command with regard to basic turtle instructions, may revert to
seemingly purposeless behavior when in initial contact with a new
command or idea.

1Behaviors Observed:
.br
11.1 A student sees no connection between commands typed at the computer
terminal, and the actions of the turtle.
.br
Example:0 The student looks only at the text display screen.
Following a teacher's instruction, s/he may type instructions such as
FORWARD 100 or RIGHT 45, without looking at the graphics display screen
to see what the turtle does.  Such a student is likely to be more
interested in messages typed by the computer such as "YOU HAVEN'T TOLD
ME HOW TO FD19", than in the motion of the turtle.

11.2. A student types random instructions on the keyboard, and then looks
to see what the turtle has done.
.br
1Example:0 Having as yet no basis for predicting the types of
inputs that might be useful for controlling the turtle, a student may
type commands such as
FORWARD 555 or RIGHT 123, choosing numbers on
the basis of previously familiar number patterns, or because they are
easy to type.  The student then looks at the screen to see what has
happened, but is often confused by seemingly random effects or "OUT OF
BOUNDS" messages.

11.3 0A student who has seemingly mastered the sense of command with
regard to turtle commands such as FORWARD and BACK, RIGHT and LEFT,
etc., reverts to the use of random inputs when given the opportunity to
make use of a procedure such as POLY or POLYSPI (see section 2 below).

1Example0:  Having not understood the connection of the POLY
procedure with FORWARD and RIGHT command with which s/he is already
familiar, the student chooses inputs to POLY such as 123 456 or
555 555, based on their familiarity with number patterns or
because they are easy to type.  Working in this way, the student may see
no consistency between the inputs to POLY and the results obtained, and
may temporarily lose a sense of controlling the behavior of the turtle.
