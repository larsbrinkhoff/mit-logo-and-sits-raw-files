 
Only___n  years ago, the introduction of portable computers into
an elementary school for student use would have been
impossible.  The enormous expense, not to mention the bulk,
of such machines, precluded any wide-scale use other than as
time- and money-savers in business.  However, it has been
clear for sometime now that technological advances,
particularly in etching and storing memory on chips of
silicon, have meant that prices have been dropping in a
fairly predictable fashion and that size of computers and
computational devices in general have become more mana-
geable.  This process has been evident even to th casual
observer: digital watches, pocket-size calculators are
everywhere; toys like speak and spell and the Little
Professor are enjoyed by many thousands of children; some
small computers have found their way into the homes of
hobbyists, and--to an ever-increasing extent--into the
schools.  Despite these advances, the style  of using
computers in the schools still retains a strong flavor of
technological primitivity.  The most common computer
language* there in use, BASIC, is meager in its vocabulary
and cannot easily be put to exciting use by children.  The
poverty of that language is largely explainable int erms of
its efficient use of formerly quite expensive computer time;
in addition its proponents have been attracted by its formal
elevance, a quality children do not normally appreciate in
such abstraction.  The prevalence of BASIC as the school
computer lingua franca together with the extreme scarcity of
school computers, then, largely accounts for the rather
boring use of computers as instruments for drill and
practice.

During this period of development, some researchers have
given thought to more creative ways in which children might
use computers.  The LOGO language, developed at the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Laboratories under the direction of
Prof. Seymour Papert, a mathematician and Piagetian
psychologist, consistently favors fluency of expression over
technical efficienty.  The aim of the LOGO group has been
creation of a language and learning environment, not for
technicians, but for children and non-speacialists.  

Because of the generosity of Mr. Erik Jonson, the
farsightedness of Texas Instruments and the happy
collaboration between Lamplighter teachers and parents and
the MIT LOGO group, the present project has been made
possible.  The Lamplighter Computer Project is the absolute
first oif its kind.  There are now ___ computers available
to Lamplighter stuydents to use in school, to take home to
be hooked up to your television set.  There should be
computer activities that can interest your whole family. 

This, of course, must still sound quite mysterious.  What is
this home computer?  What does it do?  How is it used?

A brief description of the technical aspects of the computer
is presented in the Appendix.  This has been written not
only for specialists, but for anyone interested in learning
more about the machine and the relations between its
capabilities and user function.  For the moment, we would
not that with the TI Machine it will be possible:
--To draw colorful, exciting, and occasionally beautiful graphics
designs;
--To write and edit text, which can then be printed out on
the ______ at the school;
--To compose and play music;
--To simulate physical properties of and among objects
represented on the screen 8e.g. gravity, force, velocity);
--To play games.

This list, which is not exhaustive, includes activities that
can now be carried out in a qualitatively different way than
they have been in the past.  Take, or example, music
composition.  In the past, it was generally necessary for
someone untrained in music first to learn to read music and
then to learn to play an instrument before trying out
composing.
Wihtout these skills, it was almost impossible toncompare
phrases, jugle them up, and compose a tune.  In order to
acquire these skills, it was often necessary to make a leap
f faith:  that someday one would gain sufficient control
over the instrument to make music.  Many of us refused to
make that leap.  Moreover, people who were trained to read
and interpret never learned to improvise.  Now it is easy to
experiment with compositional skills right from the start.
See, for example, the project described in _______ of this
manual.

As you leaf through this manual, you will see that LOGO's
emphasis has been on making creative use of computers
accessible to children.  As children have played with LOGO,
they have developed skills in such traditionally-defined
categories as geometryt, English composition, music theory,
physics, arithmetic and computer programming itself.  The
present manual has been designed to help you and ytour
entire family to become acquainted with and to enjoy the
capacities of the TI Machine.

WHY THIS MANUAL IS NECESSARY OR HOW ADULTS CAN LEARN 
LOGO

The Lamplighter Project is the first time that a large group
of adults with no previous computer experience will have han
opportunity to learn LOGO.  Much can profitably be learned
from the way children have successfully learned LOGO, but
the situation is different in more than a few respects.
Adults, unlike children, have already mastered large bodies
of knowledge.  The extent to which this knowledge is
systematized varies.  Scientists, mathematicians, and, to a
lesser extent lawyers and doctors, tend to greater
systematicity.  But even where these adults have ben quite
successful in mastering their field, they often remain
confused between process and goal.  For example, first-year
law students, who have finally organized their year-log
courses into outlines, have been heard to wonder why they
didn't start the year with commercially available outlines
and thus succeed in bypassing the hard and often tedious
reading along the way.  Other students consciously choose to
take this more sperficial approach in areas of less import
and interest and to "do all the reading" in other courses.
Others of us have not had the occasion explicitly to
systematize our knowledge.  Even so, reflection on how we
carry out certain complex everyday activities--whether it is
how to close a business deal, how to balance a budget, how
to find out what is wrong with the sprinkler system--can
provide helpful analogies for learning new activities like,
for example, programming computers.  Most of us are used to
using manuals of some sort.  Although at times this can be
an extremely frustrating experience, most of us easily refer
to the Yellow Pages, cookbooks, automobile manuals, West
Digests (if we are lawyers), PDR's (if we are doctors) and
______________(if we are in business).  

Children actively acquire knowledge through their
interactions with the world.  The systems they build are
modified to account for new experience.  Knowledge of
language, of spacial relationships, of muvch of what we
regard as common sense, is built up in this way.

What we propose by way of this manual is to give you, the
Lamplighter parents, an opportunity to choose your own path
into LOGO, mixing use of the manual--its glossaries,
terminal sessions, projects and indices--with more or less
directed, self-conceived projects. 

As a first step, it is vital that you learn to e comfortable
at the machine.  Many of us--expecially those of us iwth an
exclusive background in huymanities--are quite intimidated
by anything that appears to be "technical". The best way to
overcome this lack of confidence (just in case it exists) is
to sit down and play around.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HURT THE
MACHINE BY PRESSING THE WRONG KEYS!!!

The Primer section of the Manual and Beginners' LOGO* are
especially designed to make your intial contact as enjoyable
(and painless) as possible.

Next, you can turn to a section in the manual that you find
interesting.  You will note that the most important commands
are presented first.  The listing of commands is not meant
to suggest that you should necessarily begin the section by
committing these to memory.  YTou may find that trying the
Terminal Session first is more helpful.  From there you may
continue further in that section or turn to another.  There
is no one way.  

As you run into problems (e.g. your program* doesn't do what
you intended it to do, you get an unexpected error message*,
you have more to handle than you think you can in one
procedure*) it will probably be useful to consider some of
the "Big Ideas" that have been stressed in teaching LOGO to
children.  "Big Ideas" are ideas about how to debug* a
procedure* we have written or how best to debug our thinking
about the procedure.  The first thing is to avoid the sense
that bugs are somehow "bad" or embarrassing.  The computer
world--and, in fact, the world at large--is filled with
bugs.  Such bugs can often be illuminating, opening whole ew
ways of considering the problem at hand.  It is not at all
unusual to hear a bug described as "great".

Most children have begun learning LOGO by way of turtle
graphics* and turtle geometry.*  LOGO was especially designed
so that it comported with a child:s intuitive sense of how
his body moved about in space.   Thus, at as moment of
confusion or indecision in the process of drawing a
picture--or writing a program to draw a picture--the
injunction to "Play Turtle", i.e. to put yourself in the
place of the turtle, is often helpful.  Perhaps an example
will help to illustrate what some of these big ideas are
while at the same time showing the process by which children
acquire LOGO knowledge. 

<Use wishing well example.  Describe child first trying to
trace the figure around.  Mention that aim will be to write
a procedure to do this and say what this is.  Include bugs,
say one in the angle of the triangle and second,
misconnecting the square to the triangle.  Play turtle can
be brought in at this point.  Then introduce "divide and
conquer" and subprocedures.>

HOW THIS MANUAL IS DESIGNED

In this introduction, we have tried to provide an overview
regardint the uses of the computer and some ideas concerning
its educational effects.  The next section, A Guide to
Beginner's LOGO, is recommended, especially if you have had
no previous experience with a computer language.  The third
section contains various short chapters which provide
alternate routes into LOGO.  They are all self-contained.
You can go to whichever section interests you the most.
Each of these sections presents information in blocks.  If,
for example, your child is interested in music but you are
not, you might be satisfied with a knowledge of the basic
commands so that you can better understand what he or she is
doing.  Or, if you are most interested in experimenting with
the music section, you might still like to learn the basic
graphics commands in order to set up a button-box* for a
younger child (see section ___).  The appendices provide
descriptions of what a computer language is and tell you
about the TI machine in some more detail.  Two glossaries
are provided.  One is a general glossary of some 
words, familiar and unfamiliar, that you will find
throughout this manual.  When a word which is defined in the
general glossary first appears in the manual, it is
indicated with a *.  Secondly, you will find a glossary of
"error messages"*.  Finally, an index has been provided to
give you a quick way to etc. <is this getting carried away?
Is it necessary to have both a general glossary AND an
index?>
