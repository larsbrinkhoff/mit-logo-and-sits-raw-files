12. Learning Styles in the LOGO Environment
                        
0In this chapter and in Chapter 3 which deals with "exceptional"
students, we present brief summaries of the learning experiences of
several of our experimental subjects.  In presenting the different
learning processes of several individuals we describe varied
approaches to geometry, computer programming, choice of
projects, planning and debugging and problem solving that are available
to students of LOGO.  Each summary has been chosen to illustrate a
particular approach to LOGO.  The work of these students and of the
rest of our experimental sample is described more fully in Part III of
this report, in which detailed, comprehensive profiles of the
work of each of our sixteen subjects are presented.

We present here a summary of the experiences of four students, Kathy,
Deborah, Donald and Kevin.
Kathy specialized in a "bottom-up"
approach, building up complex designs from a set of modular
subprocedures.  Deborah also made use of a "bottom-up" approach
although hers was based on exploring the effects of long sequences of
direct commands, selecting successful designs and copying the steps to
create procedures.  Eventually Deborah learned to make use of
subprocedures and planned and carried out a major project.  Donald
worked in a "top-down" manner, starting with a definite plan, writing a
superprocedure to define his project, and carefully planning each
sub-procedure before carrying it out.  Kevin's work fit somewhere
between Donald's and Deborah's; his plans were more vague than Donald's
and he was willing to alter them as he worked, while creating structures
that helped him carry out his projects.

11. Kathy: A Modular, Bottom-Up Approach to LOGO Activities.

0Kathy was a student with a subtle sense of humor who derived a
great deal of intellectual pleasure from her work.  
When difficulties were encountered,
she preferred to resolve them on her own, although without a great deal
of persistence.  When she did ask for help, she usually accepted the
teacher's suggestions, and readily learned new ideas in the context of
the projects in which she was engaged.

.he2
Kathy: Naming Procedures
Kathy carried out dozens of small projects in the course of her LOGO
experience.  She shifted back and forth between open ended explorations
and small goal directed projects.  Her favorite activity was to repeat
and combine existing procedures to produce unexpected results.
Often she would interrupt an exploration to pursue a particular idea
which had been suggested to her by the designs she had just created.

One of the ways in which Kathy structured her work was in her choice of
procedure names.  Her procedure names often indicated the relationship
between a new procedure, and the subprocedures from which it had been
built.  Thus, a symmetrical design was called BARN because it was built
by repeating a subprocedure called HORSE.  A procedure called WORMY was
made by doubling all the sizes in a similar design called WORM.  And,
in a rare example of top-down naming, a procedure called MONSTER was
made up of subprocedures MO, NS, and TER.

.he2
Kathy: Naming Procedures
Kathy's approach to her work is exemplified by a series of small
projects which made use of a BOX and a TRIANGLE procedure as
fundamental building blocks.  The BOX and TRIANGLE procedures
were constructed during periods of careful, goal-directed
explorations.

Box was the first procedure completed by Kathy and her group, and they
immediately followed by constructing a series of figures making use of
BOX as a subprocedure.  (See examples in section 1.3.2 of Chapter 5).
It was quite natural for her to repeat TRIANGLE as well.  She was
pleased with the result, calling it BUTTERFLY.  She then repeated
BUTTERFLY six times until the figure "closed".  This new design she
called 7BUTTERFLY (reflecting an initial miscount of how many repeats
of the BUTTERFLY procedure she had used).

Following her initial exploration with triangles, Kathy's teacher
suggested that she put her TRIANGLE and BOX procedures together to make
a "house".  After some goal-directed exploration, the HOUSE procedure
resulted.  Kathy immediately repeated HOUSE four times (calling this
new procedure HOUSE4) until the design
closed.  Next she wanted to see how her HOUSE4  and 7BUTTERFLY designs
would go together.  She named the result HB47, indicating its
relationship to HOUSE4 and 7BUTTERFLY.

This set of projects culminated when Kathy declared that HB47 "looks
like a spider," and returned to goal-directed activity, adding a series
of circles to the design, to produce the procedure SPI.

Although Kathy had constructed HB47 and its subprocedures by repeating
simple shapes over and over to make a symmetrical design, she was also
able to make explicit use of both right/left symmetry and similarity of
shape in the process of constructing her "spider".  It was this
combination of more or less random explorations 
involving existing procedures, with expert use of heuristics such
as similarity and symmetry when working in a goal-directed manner, that
most commonly characterized Kathy's work.

.he2
Deborah: Working Style
.block 5
12. Deborah: A Contrasting "Bottom-Up" Approach

0Unlike Kathy, who is a bright student, successful in all of her
academic work, Deborah is considered to be a "slow learner".  In class
she often appears to be withdrawn, indifferent to the subject matter or
to her fellow students.  When she began work in LOGO, she was totally
dependent on the teacher -- requiring his reassurance on matters as
routine as when to type a carriage return.

Deborah was able to build her confidence and understanding slowly by
limiting her choices of LOGO commands and inputs, limiting the goals of
her work, and by working in a way that minimized the chances of error.
It was as if Deborah invented an unstated set of rules governing her
work in LOGO which helped her to be successful.

Deborah used as few different commands as possible in her work.  Basic
TURTLE commands along with RARC and LARC were almost the only commands
she used.   For inputs to TURTLE commands, she used only multiples of
10, up to 100.  If a larger effect was needed, she would use additional steps,
as in FORWARD 90, FORWARD 30.  In fact, Deborah began by using only inputs of 30,
and gradually expanded to include other numbers, while continuing to
use 30, 60 and 90 as her favorites.

Deborah's patience in a one-step-at-a-time mode of operation was quite
remarkable.  Her format was quite stereotyped.  (1) carry out one
TURTLE step (turn, move or penup); (2) check to see if that looks right
on the screen; (3) if so, write down the step and continue; (4) if not,
clear the screen, retype all the steps previously written down and try
another choice for the questionable one.

While Deborah began her LOGO experience by asking for help at literally
every turn, she had a deeply engrained resistance to new ideas or
concepts.  For a long time she rejected the use of subprocedures,
although that modification in strategy would have greatly expanded her
possibilities.  It was as though she deliberately provided herself with
a very definite and restricted "microworld" in which to operate.

.he2
Deborah: Drawing a Star
On the other hand, the "microworld" which Deborah chose for herself,
the world of FORWARD 30 RIGHT 30, is very nearly as rich as all of
Turtle Geometry.  It includes squares, triangles, "circles," stars,"
"men," "rabbits," and a variety of abstract designs, as well as the
mathematical concepts of perpendicularity, inverse operations, the
Total Turtle Trip theorem, symmetry, similarity, estimation of lengths
and angles, planning and debugging, and procedure writing.

By limiting her inputs to numbers such as 30, 60 and 90, Deborah
enhanced the possibility that her explorations would produce interesting
results.  At the same time, she seemed to have a high degree of visual
intuition, often choosing precisely the correct input to produce a
desired effect.  For example, during one LOGO session the class watched
a film which featured computer designs, among them, a six-pointed star.
When Deborah came back to class, she drew a six-pointed star with the
computer, without making a single mistake.  She began by turning the
TURTLE RIGHT 30, and used a combination of FORWARD 70s and RIGHT 60s to
complete the star.  The actual rotations required to construct the star
were RIGHT 120 at the points, and LEFT 60 at the inner vertices.  The
way Deborah accomplished these rotations was quite typical of her work.
After each forward step, Deborah would turn the TURTLE RIGHT 60.  She
kept turning it RIGHT 60, until the TURTLE was headed in the right
direction.  This required two repeats of RIGHT 60 at each point, and
five repeats of RIGHT 60 at each inner vertex.  At one inner vertex she
missed the correct orientation, and calmly repeated RIGHT 60 for a
total of eleven times until the TURTLE was aimed in the right
direction.  When she copied the steps in her notebook, she copied all
eleven RIGHT 60s without any hesitation.

Deborah: Drawing a Rabbit
It was not until quite late in the series of classes that Deborah was
ready to undertake a major project.  She drew a picture of a rabbit in
her notebook, and asked the teacher if he thought that would make a
good project.  He suggested modifying the rabbit, to make use of
straight rather than curved lines, and redrew the picture for her in
more simplified form.

.block 15
.sp 13
.ce
Figure 2.2

Although Deborah began by trying to draw the rabbit as a long series of
commands, she quickly accepted her teacher's suggestion that she break
the problem into parts, and make each part a separate subprocedure.
While her work was directed toward an overall goal, and involved a
certain amount of "top-down" planning, she constructed the rabbit piece
by piece, in her usual exploratory fashion.  Once again her choice of
inputs to FORWARD and RIGHT comands were such that it was relatively
easy for her to make the design come out the way she wanted.  Without
any apparent planning, she chose the length for the sides of the
rabbit's head (FORWARD 90 FORWARD 30) in a way that made it easy for
her to locate the eyes and nose symmetrically.  The angles and lengths
she chose for the ears -- a departure from her usual 30 or 60 degrees
-- resulted in almost perfect symmetry.  Details of the project
are given in the profile of Deborah's work, in part III of this report.

Donald: Working Style
With the completion of her rabbit project, Deborah had almost totally
reversed her initial feelings of dependence and incompetence.  She
invited her parents, teachers and school principal to visit the
computer lab, and in many ways, demonstrated to her visitors and
classmates her new found sense of confidence, satisfaction and power.

.block 5
13. Donald: A Structured, Top-Down Approach to LOGO Activities

0Donald provides a striking contrast to both Kathy and Deborah.
Donald's work was characterized by a strong component of advanced
planning, and the creating of structures within which problems could be
solved.  At the same time, Donald was quite ineffective at the
visually-based, exploratory modes of problem solving which were so
useful to Kathy and Deborah.  He had difficulty estimating angles, and
making use of the visual feedback provided by his explorations to
improve his next attempt.

Throughout his work Donald was extremely receptive to suggestions from
the teacher, often making use of new ideas before he fully understood
them.  In this way, he was able to incorporate into his way of working,
strategies that would continue to prove useful, as he gradually came to
understand them through use in more than one context.  He seemed to
have the confidence that he could make use of the teacher's suggestions
effectively and that he would eventually understand them, even if the
concepts were a bit hazy at first.

As an example of both the effectiveness and drawbacks associated with
Donald's structured planning approach as well as of his difficulties
with visual approaches to problem solving, we consider his construction
of a "house" from a square and a triangle, a common LOGO task, tackled
by many students at an early stage of their LOGO experience.

At first Donald attempted an exploratory approach to solving this
problem.  He began by drawing a triangle on the screen, making use of
TRI, a state transparent equilateral triangle procedure:

.nofill
.block 13


TO TRI
1 FORWARD 100
2 RIGHT 120
3 FORWARD 100
4 RIGHT 120
5 FORWARD 100
6 RIGHT 120
END

.ri
Figure 3.1

.adjust
Having started with the triangle, the framework Donald established for
solving the problem involved changing the "normal" orientation of a
"house," to correspond to the initial orientation of the triangle. When
Donald was asked to draw a picture of what he was trying to accomplish,
he made this diagram:

.block 12
.sp 10
.ce
Figure 3.2

Since he was now dealing with two disorientations, the gap between
the TRI and BOX procedures, and the tilted orientation of the entire
shape, Donald had more difficulty than he could handle, and in an
entire period of exploration, he never succeeded in resolving the
problem in this form.

At the next class, the teacher suggested that Donald draw the BOX
first.  This suggestion provided him with enough new insight to devise
a plan for solving the problem.  Donald's plan allowed him to avoid the
usual problem of finding the rotation needed to attach the triangle to
the upper left hand corner of the box.

.block 16
.sp 14
.ce
Figure 3.3

Instead, Donald moved the TURTLE to the upper right hand corner of the
box, reversed its direction, and then drew the triangle so that its
first side was along the top of the box.

Donald: Drawing a Head
.adjust
.block 3
Donald had one major project which occupied him for more than 12 class
periods -- more time than any other student devoted to a single
project.  Typically, this project began with a plan, a cartoon-like
drawing of a man's head, which formed the basis of Donald's work.
After one brief session of exploratory work, Donald revised his plan,
and worked with his teacher to create a superprocedure, designed to
draw the entire figure.

.block 28
.sp 24
.spread
/Donald's First Plan//Donald's Revised Plan
.spread
/Figure 3.5//Figure 3.6

Donald's original superprocedure, TO HEAD, included the first six
features of the head:  the outside (BOX), EYES, NOSE, MOUTH, BEARD and
HAIR.  Once the superprocedure was written, each subprocedure became a
mini-project, requiring one or two classes to resolve.  Each feature of
the head required it's own construction plan, a combination of the
analysis and exploration needed to carry it out.  While working on the
features of his head, Donald make use of a great deal of teacher
assistance -- especially in developing approaches to geometric analysis
that were necessary to overcome his difficulties with visual problem
solving. 

.he2
Kevin: Writing Style
In the course of his work Donald encountered estimation of distances
and angles, the geometry of arcs and circles, the Total Turtle Trip
theorem, and the use of both grid-based and intrinsic coordinate
systems.  He learned to use subprocedures and sub-subprocedures, to use
patterned procedures making use of a REPEAT command, to make use of
variables to control the size and shape of his "hat" and "flower" and
to use a POLY procedure with a conditional stop rule.  Although Donald
only "learned" these approaches to the extent necessary to solve the
particular problems inherent in his project, each succeeding use of the
same concept, reinforced his exposure to it, deepening his sense of
mastery. 

Donald's final figure, drawn by the superprocedure, HEAD, represents an
almost literal translation of his revised plan, figure 3.6, into a
computer program.

14. Kevin:  An Expert "TURTLE Driver"; an Intermediate Example
.br

0In his LOGO work, Kevin combined certain qualities that were present
in the styles of Kathy, Deborah and Donald.  What particularly
distinguished Kevin's style from that of the other three students
discussed in this chapter was his superior ease and comfort in
manipulating the TURTLE -- both in moving the TURTLE from place to
place on the graphics display screen, and in finding ways of combining
and simplifying series of turtle steps, to facilitate his work.

.he2
Kevin: Drawing a "Turtle"
Like Deborah, Kevin worked in a linear step-by-step fashion, taking
careful notes as he worked.  Unlike Deborah, Kevin was able to examine
his lists of steps, (combining FORWARD 150, BACK 10 into one step,
FORWARD 140, for instance) eliminating unnecessary steps.  Like
Deborah, Kevin chose inputs to LOGO commands and procedures very
effectively.  Unlike Deborah, he often made connections between the
inputs he used.  For example, when drawing a right isosceles triangle
he began with a rotation of 45 degrees.  When asked why he chose 45
degrees, Kevin had two responses: first, "it looked about right" and
second, "45 is half of 90".

.block 11
.sp 9
.ce
Figure 4.1

Kevin was also like Donald in that he usually engaged in goal directed
work, including one long term project, and in that he made use of
particular structures to help him resolve issues that arose in carrying
out his projects.  Unlike Donald, he did not participate in creating
those structures for himself, nor did he engage in any significant
advanced planning.  In his major project, drawing a large "turtle",
Kevin learned to use subprocedures to break his problem into manageable
"chunks" or when he needed to repeat the same procedure more than once
as part of his project.  The names Kevin chose for his procedures and
subprocedures sometimes had a random quality, such as the name OF for a
procedure which drew a triangle, or the name LIFS for a procedure that
drew a set of nested squares.

Kevin's project to draw a large "turtle" provides examples of the way
in which utilized various structures to help with his work.  Having
drawn a circle of radius 90, to form the "shell" of his "turtle", Kevin
made use of an arc procedure that turns through a variable angle, as a
way of moving around the "turtle's" shell.  He had noticed that the small
dots which appeared when the circle and arc procedures were used
occured at
intervals of 10 degrees.  Using this discovery he created a system of
intrinsic coordinates for the purpose of moving around his "turtle's" shell.
He would count the dots, and use an angle input of 40 to move a
distance of 4 dots along the shell, etc.

Another structure which Kevin used to draw his "turtle", was the
creation of the modular subprocedures, FOOT and BKFOOT.  Kevin would
move the LOGO TURTLE around the "turtle's" shell using an arc command
until he reached the point where he needed to locate a "foot" of the
"turtle".  The two procedures, FOOT and BKFOOT, were equivalent to a
state transparent procedure which drew a foot of the "turtle" and
returned the TURTLE to the shell, ready to move around to the next
point at which a foot would be located.
.he2
Kevin: Using Variables

.block 15
.sp 13
.ce
Figure 4.2

The last set of projects that Kevin worked on provides a nice example
of the way in which Kevin came to understand the use of variables and
stop rules.  After having explored the effects of different inputs to a
POLY procedure (see chapter 5 section 1 for a discussion of POLY),
Kevin built a design by keeping the angle constant while varying the
size of the POLY.  The teacher helped him talk through this procedure:

.nofill
.block 13


TO TUNNEL :SIZE
10 POLY :SIZE 45
20 IF :SIZE - 105 STOP
30 TUNNEL :SIZE+5
END
.sp 3

.RI
Figure 4.3

Next, he repeated the process with an angle of 90 degrees:

.block 12


TO LIFS :SIZE
10 POLY :SIZE 90
20 IF :SIZE = 150 STOP
30 LIFS :SIZE + 2
END

.sp 2
.ri
Figure 4.4

.adjust
Kevin then asked if "the amount the POLYs grow each time" could be
changed, and if the largest size could be changed.  He picked the
variable names "SET and "LARGE for these quantities, and with some
syntax help from his teacher,  wrote the procedure:

.nofill
.block 13


TO UFC :SIZE :SET :LARGE
10 POLY :SIZE 90
20 IF :SIZE = :LARGE STOP
30 UFC :SIZE + :SET :SET :LARGE
END

.sp 3
.ri
Figure 4.5

.adjust
In the course of exploring the use of different inputs to this
procedure, Kevin was delighted to discover that keeping all the inputs
the same had the effect of producing a variable sized square.  He
understood that the reason the procedure drew only one square was that
the starting and ending sizes were identical.

.he2
Other Students
Kevin's major difficulty in using the computer was an initial
reluctance to plan ahead or to structure his work more than one step at
a time.  When new ideas were presented to him in a way that enabled him
to simplify his work, he was able to absorb them relatively painlessly
and incorporate them into his thinking.

.block 5
15.  Working Styles of the Other Students.

0We have given a description of the differences in learning style
among four different students carrying out very similar tasks in order
to provide a sense of the differences that existed among all
16 of the students.  To offer a better some sense of the scope of these
variations among the group, we will attempt a differentiation of the
rest of our 16 students based on how their approaches compared with
those of our models.  Since this greatly oversimplifies the different
ways in which these students worked, the reader is urged to read the
full profiles in Part II of this report, and the descriptions of the
work of exceptional children presented in the next chapter, to get a
better sense of the flavor of each child's particular LOGO experience.

Monica and Darlene showed a lot of similarity to Kathy's style of work.
Both made a lot of use of repetition to create designs, and preferred
small, easily completed explorations to long term projects.  Neither had
Kathy's interest in relating the procedure names that they used to the
ways in which their procedures were constructed.  Darlene was unusually
curious about the possibilities inherent in the LOGO language, and in
the computer system we were using, and explored a lot of different
kinds of projects, without settling on any major area of interest.

Although Jimmy was a quicker and more articulate learner than Deborah,
his work was similar to hers in many respects.  He worked in a linear
step-by-step fashion, limiting himself to a few key ideas in carrying
out LOGO tasks.  He had a great deal of resistance to suggestions for
new ways of doing things, and had difficulty making effective use of
subprocedures.  Jimmy was also like Deborah in his excellent intuitive
manipulation of the TURTLE.  Jimmy's work had a much finer level of
detail than Deborah's, and like Kathy, he was able to make excellent
use of symmetry and similarity in planning his steps.

Dennis and Harriet showed a certain amount of similarity to
Donald, in the way that they made use of top-down approaches and in the
structures they needed to carry out their work.  Dennis also
had difficulties with solving problems by visual exploration, similar
to those encountered by Donald.  Harriet had no difficulty with visual
explorations but preferred to work on challenging tasks in which the
visual effects were less important than other aspects of programming.
In particular, Harriet carried out two elaborate interactive projects
-- designing a tictactoe game, and writing a "madlib" program.
Although Harriet needed help with the syntax and programming knowledge
to carry out these tasks, she was able to understand how to create
complicated structures for her projects, once she was given
a model of how they functioned.

Laura probably belongs in a category of her own.  Her projects tended
to involve large scale designs, which required complex strucures.
Although her creative ideas were sophisticated and unusual, she lacked
the patience and insight necessary to develop the structures she needed
to carry them out.  Since Laura did not like to ask for help, or to
appear to be having difficulties, she experienced some frustration from
time to time.

Karl, Albert and Betsy all had a degree of similarity to Kevin, in that
they utilized a mixture of top-down and bottom-up approaches, and that
they were able to make use of the particular structures needed to carry
out a task without necessarily understanding those structures in a more
general way.  Karl and Albert tended to prefer shorter projects, while
Betsy usually worked on more complex projects, making use of a number
of subprocedures.

Gary, Tina, and Ray worked in more unique ways that cannot easily be
compared to those of our four "model students,"  Their work will be
examined, along with Karl's, in Chapter 3 dealing with exceptional
children.
