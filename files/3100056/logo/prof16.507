Relationship With Computer

116.  Tina0

Tina is a student who has great difficulty with academic work.
In mathematics and language she is considered to be several
years behind her classmates (her national achievement test scores place
her in the 3nd percentile).  Although she receives several hours of
special tutoring in the school's Learning Center each week, the staff 
is concerned about her rate of
progress, and are struggling to find an
appropriate educational program for her as she enters seventh grade.

From the beginning of her LOGO classes, Tina's work
provided an exception to most of the patterns we have observed among
the rest of the students in our study.  Although Tina did very
little Turtle Geometry, she was more "involved" with the computer than
any other student.  She developed an almost personal relationship
with the computer she used, giving it a name, and treating it in the
way some chidren treat a doll or a pet.

Tina's major use of the computer was as a typewriter and editor.
Using a text-editing program designed to allow her to use the printing
capability of the computer without writing procedures or using PRINT
commands, Tina wrote a series of nine "stories", which she distributed
to her family, friends and teachers.  These stories constituted the
most significant work of Tina's entire school year.

Tina's success in writing and completing work with the computer has
led to success in other areas as well.
Near the end of sixth grade
Tina began turning in assignments on a
regular basis -- something she had not been able to do before taking
the computer classes.  In addition, a friendship established with
Harriet, another girl in her LOGO class, has led to Tina's being
included socially with Harriet and her friends in the classroom, ending
her previous isolation.

116.1 Tina's "Personal Relationship" with the Computer

0Tina had a very special relationship with one of the computers, which
she called "Peter".  While this was most noticeable in the earlier
classes, it persisted throughout Tina's computer experience.  
In the first class, Tina expressed an interest in communicating
with the computer:  "I thought it would talk to you.  Hello."  When it
responded to a missing space in an FD445 command by printing "You
haven't told me how to FD445," Tina responded with genuine anger:  "I
did, you fool!"  "Oh, this isn't doing what I told it to do," she said
at another point.

In the next class she again asked about communication:  "I want to ask
it questions.  Oh you know, What's your name?  Things like that."  
The teacher explained that all the computer's answers would have to come
from her, and showed her how to use a PRINT command.  Her first
procedure gave the computer an answer to her first question:
.nofill

	2TO WHO
	1 PRINT [MY NAME IS PETER]
	END

.adjust
0Tina was extremely possessive about the particular machine she
regularly used. She felt that this machine, her "Peter", was hers,
and she would say things like "Take good care of Peter,"  when she left
for the day.  When she came late to the fourth class, "Peter" was
already being used by another student.  Tina stormed and fussed. "I
want to use my computer.  That's the one I use every day."  When 
the teacher
insisted they were all the same, Tina responded; "I hate you...I think
I'm going to cry..." 
Finally she was persuaded to use another computer and was somewhat
reassured by the fact that it responded correctly to WHO, once she had
logged in.  Although she actually worked quite successfully
the other students all left "Tina's computer" to
her in succeeding classes.

As the classes went on, Tina's relationship with "Peter" tempered
somewhat.  The teacher continued to stress that the computer was a machine,
controlled by her and other programmers.  
Gradually she reduced her expression of anger at the computer,
as she realized how error messages were related to what
she had done, although she continued to share credit for her
work with "Peter". "Do you want to see the stories me and Peter have
written?"  she would ask a visitor.  And she would often introduce
visitors to "Peter", using her WHO procedure.

.he2
Working Style
By the time the classes ended, Tina had progressed to a more
balanced understanding of her role in relation to the computer.  
Her behavior with the computer had become much more matter-of-fact
and she had begun to interact very extensively with the other children
in the class.  As she came to understand the mechanical predictability
with which the computer responded to her, and as she began to take
pride in her accomplishments in story writing, "Peter" came more and
more to take on the status of a personal fantasy -- one which a child
knows is a fantasy, but persists in "playing" sometimes because
it's fun.

.block 5
116.2  Tina's way of working with the Computer

0The strongest characteristic of Tina's approach to working with the
computer was her need to clear the text display screen.  While many
children have a desire to clear the screen between projects, or when
bored or frustrated, Tina exhibited this desire in an extreme way.
One of Tina's first questions was about "how to get the words off the
screen," and learning how to accomplish this using the carriage return
was a major discovery of hers during the first class.  Once she figured
out how to do it she cleared the text display after almost every line
-- especially after error messages.
In later classes Tina developed the habit of clearing the
text display before logging in, after logging in, after almost every
instruction that was not part of an ongoing task, and before and after
saying GOODBYE.

Tina's habit of clearing the text display in this way interferred
significantly with her learning.  It effectively prevented her from
maintaining continuity in what she was doing, and eliminated the
possibility of her responding to the computer's error messages.  Even
after completing a piece of work Tina would hardly look at it:  after
she had 
edited her first letter, DORIS, she swept it
off the screen without reading it.

In per pre-LOGO interview, Tina used a similar strategy when strying to
arrange a series of permutations of a set of colored blocks.  The task
was to create as many different arrangements of the blocks as possible.
 After having done a few, Tina swept the old ones away, clearing the
table -- thus making it impossible for her to know whether the next one
was different or not.  When the interviewer re-established all Tina's
old arrangements, she made one more, and then compulsively swept them
all away again.

Tina eventually learned to leave several sequential lines on the screen, while
working on a specific project -- although it required a definite effort
on her part not to endulge her carriage return habit.  When working on
a drawing project, she would carefully copy all the necessary steps
into her notebook, then quickly clear the screen.

Tina had a strong desire for completion and correctness in all her
work.  
Although she was quite a perfectionist by her own standards,
sometimes working a whole hour on one story,
Tina never proofread, edited or added to a story once
she had declared it finished.  Unless she noticed an error in
a particular line while typing it, or immediately after typing a
carriage return, she never went back to find an error.  Once a story
was done, it was done!  She might show it to other people, but she
rarely read it over to herself, and certainly not with a view to
analyze or correct it.  Incidents like the following were observed
several times.  Tina was proofreading a sentence which began "ONCE
UPON TIME..."  but she read aloud, "Once upon a time..." and
continued, satisfied that her work was correct.

Tina did develop one way of editing stories.  If she made a mistake
early in a story she could start the entire process again by typing
END, and clearing the screen.  Typing LET LETTER again would clear out
her workspace and allow her to begin her story again.  
When she did this, she almost always typed an identical sentence to the
one she had typed before -- without any printed reference -- sometimes
complete with the error that had forced her to start over in the first
place.  In such case she would stop and go through the whole process
again until she got it right.

(Tina's attitude towards errors and towards completion of "correct"
work is also shown by her behavior in other situations.  One of her
learning disability tutors related that she would repeatedly throw out
whole pages once she had made one error -- a tactic that frustrated her
in working with a standard typewriter.  Hence in her written work she
had developed a style of writing only short pieces of one or two
"perfect" sentences.)

Tina also had a great desire for neatness in the classroom.  She took
it upon herself to collect and put away pens, notebooks, and other
items which had been left out by the other children, and to
remind them to put their things away.

In her work with the computer, Tina established a set of
conditions about what she would and wouldn't do, and adhered to these
with little change throughout the classes.  Tina would do the
following:  LOGIN "TINA; LET LETTER (to get her letter writing
procedure); start, write and end a letter; run a letter or a drawing
procedure by typing its name; and type the word GOODBYE.  Things she
wouldn't do on her own included:  writing a procedure;
editing a procedure or a story; saving a procedure, by writing a file;
reading a file; and using the lineprinter.  These parts of her daily routine
were done for her by her teacher.

.he2
Turtle Geometry
It was very important for Tina to keep a firm boundary
between what she would and wouldn't do.  Towards the end of
the classes, an effort was made to get her to use the lineprinter on her
own, showing her the PRINTON command, and showing her how to make
multiple copies of a story by using REPEAT.  At first Tina objected to this
strongly, but eventually agreed to do some of it.
With stronger insistence and more time, Tina might
have learned these
commands, and attained a greater measure of independence in her
computer use.

Tina took a large part of each class
to settle down to productive work.  She usually came to class
later than the other students, and wandered around a bit before
deciding what to do.  Once started on a story, she often made a lot of
mistakes on the first line -- requiring her to start the whole story
over again.  Once past the first line, however, she typically finished
a story without any more false starts.  Her problem with starting was
reflected in a rush at the end of the class.  Since Tina placed a
premium on completed work, she often found it necessary to stay after
class to finish up.

116.3. Tina's Use of the Turtle

0Tina used the TURTLE in only nine of the twenty-four class sessions.  Most of
her use of the TURTLE required active help from the teacher or one of the other
students.

From the beginning, Tina had great difficulty concentrating on what
the TURTLE was doing in response to the commands she typed.  In the
first class she literally "dozed off" while the rest of the
class was figuring out how to draw a box, and how to write a procedure.
When she began to work on her own, she worked randomly,
copying commands from an instruction sheet without looking at their
effect, and clearing the actual commands from the text display almost
as quickly as she typed them.  For numerical inputs she chose double
numbers like 55, sequences like 34, or combinations like 445.  At the
end of the period she wrote a few steps and a comment in her notebook:

.block 7
.sp 5
.ce
Figure 16.1

.adjust
0Although Tina seemed to have difficulty throughout the first class in
focussing on what the turtle was doing in response to her typing,
she did notice when the command HT 78 made the TURTLE disappear, and
asked for help saying "I want my TURTLE back."  She had a much stronger
response to the computer's text responses -- angrily commenting about
error messages and sweeping them off the screen with a stream of
carriage returns.

In the second class she was more thoughtful about what she was doing,
eventually noticing that she had caused the computer to draw a
"seven", and carefully copying down the steps in her notebook:

.nofill

.sp 6
.ce

0With much help, this was made into the 
procedure SEVEN, copying the

	END
.ce

0In another class Tina decided in advance that she wanted the computer to
draw a "zero".  When asked to draw a zero by hand, she drew it
as a rectangle, possibly indicating that she understood that it was easier for
the TURTLE to draw straight lines than to draw curves.  She required a
great deal of help in building her
rectangle with the TURTLE.
Tina could not
determine the angle to use at each corner of the rectangle, although
she did know that opposite sides had to have the same length.  She
decided to call her rectangle TINA and carefully copied the steps into
her notebook.

When she taught her procedure to the computer, Tina had difficulty
copying the steps.  When she typed 66 as a line number
instead of 6, Tina insisted on redoing the entire procedure
instead of
editing.  When the same thing happened again, she allowed the teacher to
fix it, by
erasing the line for her.

0With Harriet's help, Tina then spent some time repeating her design,
and making it spin.  She never returned to Turtle Geometry activities
on her own.

.he2
Writing Stories
0If Tina had not had the possibility of using
the computer to write stories, she might have persevered with drawing a
lot more.  Her experience with the "zero" drawing shows that she
was capable of seeing the connection between the commands she was
giving and what the TURTLE was drawing.  On the other hand, Tina was
delighted with using the computer to write stories.  This was a unique
and special use of the computer, and she did not have to compare her
work with anyone else's.   Drawing with the computer may have seemed to
be just another activity at which she was "not as good" as her classmates.

.block 4
116.4 Tina's Stories

0Most of Tina's time and effort with the computer was devoted to
writing.  A special program, LETTER was created for her use, allowing
her to type a story directly into the computer without having to write a
procedure, or use line numbers or PRINT commands.  Tina used the LETTER
procedure to write two "letters" and seven "stories" over a period
spanning twenty classes.  She also started at least three more stories
that were discarded before she finished them.

In her stories, Tina had a product of which she could be proud.  She
could easily share copies with her classmates, teachers and family and
with visitors to the LOGO classes.  It was a unique product which could not 
be compared with the work of other students.  This was very important
to Tina, who was used to having her work evaluated as being of lower
quality than that of her fellow students.  Most importantly, Tina was
able to use the computer to express her ideas in writing and to improve
her writing skills in a way that she had not been able to do in regular
classes or in her special tutorial programs.

Here are Tina's nine "stories" (as she called them), beginning with
DORIS (class 4) and continuing to MISS.HIRSH (class 21).  They show
considerable development in style, sophistication and in proficiency in
grammar and punctuation.  They are presented here exactly as Tina
wrote them.

0Tina's first two stories, DORIS and HELEN, were really letters, written
to her godmother and mother respectively.  The next four were all "made
up stories about real people."  Tommy, Ann, Sonny and Donell are all
Tina's relatives.  
The last
three stories, HARRIET, MR.LEWIS and MISS.HIRSH were about a classmate,
and about Tina's regular sixth grade teachers.

In the first few classes, Tina had shown an interest in
"communicating" with the computer, and had been shown
how to write procedures using PRINT commands.

Starting with the fourth class a
special program was created for her to allow her to
type whatever she wanted
directly into the computer.  The procedure, LETTER, required that Tina
choose a name for a story, and then it interpreted each of
her typed lines as a separate "REQUEST".
If Tina wanted to change a
line she could use the rubout key, before she typed a carriage
return.  Other than that, LETTER had no special editing capability.  When
Tina finished a story, she typed END, which caused the LETTER
procedure to finish defining the procedure she had named.  It then typed out, "HERE
IS YOUR LETTER, DORIS" (for example), and ran the procedure, printing
the letter exactly as Tina typed it.  

Tina was quickly able to use the LETTER procedure on her own.
She would type LETTER, choose a name for her
story, and begin.
If she wanted to change a line after typing a carriage return 
she had to be helped by the teacher.
Sometimes she accidentally typed a carriage return intending to type a
rubout.  After typing a string of carriage returns, she would often
type END and start all over.  This was Tina's only way of independently
editing a story procedure.

Tina was introduced to LETTER in class four -- the same class in which
she made such a fuss about having to use a "different" computer.  Her
letter, DORIS, was first written out by hand, and
then copied on the computer.   At the end of the class  several copies
were printed out
for her, as she carefully estimated how many she would
need:  "One for me, one for my mother, one for Doris (her godmother),"
etc.  In her notebook, Tina wrote. "Today me and Peter did a letter".

Tina's next letter was HELEN, written during class six.  This letter,
accomplished in a much shorter time, was written to her mother.  It
followed the same format as DORIS:  greeting, question, statement, signature.
Punctuation consisted of two periods.  

0In class eight, Tina wrote
a "story" she called TOMMY.  After several false starts she settled down to
complete a seven line story, which ended rather abruptly.
She had trouble typing the first line and used 
a lot of extra carriage returns between lines.
Twice she was helped to erase the story and start again.  Once she completed the first line
successfully, she went on to write seven lines, before deciding she was
finished.

The story TOMMY represented a big change from Tina's previous computer
writing, and set the tone for the rest of the writing she was to do.
In TOMMY, her concern was not for a grammatically correct careful
statement, following a prearranged format.  Rather she was concerned
with the details of the story:  the names of the characters, the places
they lived, the sequence and timing of events.  
She was reminded not to type a carriage return until she was
satisfied with an entire line, and she often rubbed out all or most of
a line to correct a spacing or spelling error.  Once a line was
finished, however, she did not ask for corrections.

0Tina's next story, ANN, ended even more
abruptly.  In this case, time ran out before she completed
it, and Tina
showed no
interest in adding to it at a later class.  
She worked very carefully on her first seven
sentences, rubbing out and rewriting as often as necessary, carefully
checking each sentence before going on.  She finally got frustrated in
starting the eighth line, typed a lot of carriage returns and called for
help.  After her mistakes had been corrected  
Tina declared the story
finished, and printed out about 10 copies, offering them to classmates
as well as to two visitors.  She appeared to have a great deal of pride
in her work.

0Tina's next story, SONNY
was her longest to date -- nine lines. 
In writing the story Tina was interested in punctuation, checking with
the teacher
to see if each period was located correctly.
At one point Tina asked whether she should use "adopt" or "adopted"
as a spelling.
The difference in meaning was explained by using each in a sentence.  
Tina seemed to be unable to hear the difference in the
way the words sounded, so that the choice was completely arbitrary
to her.  She decided to use "adopt" at that point, and throughout the
rest of the story.

Tina was clearly
using this story to express some very deep feelings and values -- as well as
some appreciation for her own parents.

.adjust
0After Tina had completed SONNY, she was asked for
some samples of the writing she was doing in class.  "I don't have time to
write stories in class," was her reply.  "I've got too much work to
do."   Tina's English teacher and her learning
disabilities teacher
both confirmed the fact that Tina had done virtually no creative writing
this year.  Her English teacher explained that Tina rarely completed
any work -- pointing out that Tina's computer stories were among
her first finished pieces of work.

Tina's next story, DONELL seemed to have the making of a real story
with a definite plot line, and realistic dialogue.
Once again, Tina had difficulty settling down to start her
story, and ran out of time before finishing it.  

After a lot of disruptive fooling around with the other kids, she
settled down to write her story,
HARRIET, which was well constructed and carefully
written.  She paid careful attention to spelling and punctuation --
asking for assurances on the placing of periods at the ends of
sentences. 

In class 20, Tina dictated a story to her friend, Deborah, who had come
as a visitor. 
The resulting
story, MR.LEWIS was Tina's longest and clearest story, and had a
more direct flow than usual in Tina's stories.  Deborah typed
the story exactly as Tina dictated -- Tina dictated the puncutation
as well.  Her verbal dictation seems to have been closer to
standard english grammar than her own typing.  The story had a clear
plot, with a definite beginning and ending.  Tina ended the story by
writing "BY TINA DEBORAH AND PETER," after thinking for a few minutes
about how to share the credit.  

.he2
Reasons for Success
0Tina's last story, MISS.HIRSH, was written in only 20
minutes.  She typed without any significant errors or
false starts.  She was particularlly concerned about the location of
periods, and the use of apostrophes in DIDN'T and HAVEN'T.  (She knew
where the apostropes went, but wanted to have that confirmed by the teacher.)
After finishing the story, Tina said with
a gleam in her eye "Miss Hirsh can take a joke."

.block 5
116.5  Some Possible Reasons for Tina's Success in Writing

0In a meeting held after the end of computer classes, Tina's English
teacher said that Tina had begun making a significant effort to
complete assignments and turn in work.  She said that Tina's computer
stories were the first completed work that Tina had turned in this year.

After consulting with Tina's teachers, some tentative insights can
be offered about
why Tina was able to
accomplish so much writing in the LOGO classes, while
she has been unable to accomplish much writing in either her regular
classes or with her language tutors.  

Tina is a fanatic about completing work without errors.  When an error
occurs in Tina's normal work, she tears up the paper and throws it
away.  Since she never examines her errors, or tries to learn from
them, errors are seen by her as a total disaster.  Using the computer,
she was able to rubout many errors as they occurred without destroying
all her work up to that point.  In this way she could be satisfied with
her finished product.  Once she declared herself "finished" she never
looked back to see if there were any other errors.

.he2
Social Behavior
The printed computer output had a "professional" quality that
looked more polished than other children's writing.  In addition, she could
have as many copies as she wanted at no extra effort -- which could
bring her positive attention from friends, family, and several
different teachers, all in the same day.

Tina seems to feel extremely
sensitive to any "correction" of her work whether direct or implied.  
This is confirmed by her abhorance of "errors".  She was not corrected
or criticised while writing, and the teacher's
assistance was confined to answering her questions about spelling and
punctuation.  
Therefore, since  Tina had worked hard to make her work "correct" and
since it looked "professional," Tina assumed that
it was correct, and was very proud of it.

Tina knew that her work was unique among the kids in the computer
classes.  Just as only Tina used the computer she called "PETER",
only Tina could use the LETTER procedure to write stories.  Thus Tina
could feel that her work was at least as good as the other students'
work.  Tina has rarely had the opportunity to feel that way about her
work.

.block 3
116.6. Tina's Social Behavior During LOGO Classes

0Just as Tina's "relationship" with the computer was of the utmost
importance to her, she also placed a high premium on her personal
relationships with the people around her.  At first Tina 
had a great deal of sensitivity about being observed by adults in the
classroom.
She was
particularly concerned about observers who took notes, and she would
occasionally ask them what they were writing about.  Tina made a
point of introducing herself to all the visitors who came at different
times to observe the classes, and of establishing a definite
relationship with any who came more than once.

Tina insisted that she be noticed.  When she came to class late, she
would often sing or shout loudly in a powerful voice as she walked in
the door.  If a visitor was present, however, she would quiet down
suddenly in embarrassment.  During any class she might call loudly
across the room to a teacher, visitor or a classmate.

At times, Tina could be quite manipulative -- especially when she
wanted help.  She could be loud and insistent calling across the room
for assistance, and a few minutes later rebuke another child for
"interrupting".  She often corrected other people's behavior, saying
that some action, or omission was "rude", or "sloppy".  This was
usually done in a somewhat cheerful, "motherly" tone that had only a
slight undercurrent of hostility.

In her relations with her classmates, Tina adopted a "breezy,"
somewhat teasing style, characterized by a cheerful good humor.
Occasionally this "breeziness" got out of control, and became
disruptive and rowdy, including chases around the room, hitting and
hair-pulling.  At such times, Tina had a very difficult time settling
back into appropriate class behavior.

At other times -- especially with visitors present -- Tina would be
extremely quiet, polite and demure.  It was as if she had two sets of
rules -- one for serious behavior in public -- the other for playful
behavior in private.  As the classes went on, it was clear that Tina
considered the LOGO classroom as a "private" place, where she was among
friends and could be her playful self.

At first Tina was tolerated, somewhat uneasily
by the other kids.
Gradually, Harriet and Dennis became quite involved with her playfulness,
and cheerful bantering.  Most of the time they seemed to enjoy the
distraction she provided, and allowed her to provide an excuse for
letting their own playfulness emerge on occasion.  

Harriet became quite protective of Tina, sticking up for her on
occasion, as well as helping her with her work from time to time.
Tina consulted Harriet frequently about spelling and
punctuation.  Harriet spent a lot of one class period helping Tina type
a TURTLE procedure, and showing her how to use the SPIN command.

Tina took a lot of interest in Harriet and Dennis as a "couple", teasing
them regularly about their friendship.  She wrote their "relationship"
into her story, HARRIET, and spent a good deal of one class period
watching them play Dynaturtle games together -- commenting regularly,
not on their dynamic strategies, but on their personal interchanges.

Harriet's interest in Tina was evidenced outside of LOGO classes as
well.  One of Tina's classroom teachers reported that she had moved
her seat in class to be near Harriet and her group of friends.  In
becoming accepted by them, she had moved from virtual "isolation into
the core of the class, socially."  Her teacher attributed this to the
relationship Tina developed during the LOGO classes and to the feeling
of success she has had with her computer work.
