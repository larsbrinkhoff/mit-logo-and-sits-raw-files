A Tentative Treatment of Tile Number and Colortray number limitations.

There will be about 200 tiles available for the user to design.  These
tiles can be designed either by using TILEPATTERN or by commanding a
turtle in DRAW-mode to travel over tiles with its pen down.

Each tile has a background and a foreground color.  Of course, they can
be the same.

Of these 200 tiles, there are a manximum of 25 color pairs possible at
one time on the screen.

These color-pair sets of 8 are colortrays.

What we propose is that the existence of colortrays be invisible to the
user until the computer "runs out of ink."

In other words, the user would be able to command a turtle to carry a
tile to a certain place and drop it.

She could then rename the transported tile (implicitly creating a new
tile) and change its color (implicitly putting the new tile in a
colortray of that color pair of one exists or beginning to fill a new
colortray if there is not a colortray of that color pair alrady).

Some examples may clarify the situation:
.br
(1)  The screen could be filled with one red tile.This would use very
little "ink" and would use only one out of eight slots in one colortray.

(2) The user could design 9 different tiles of one color pair, but this
would commit two colortrays to that color pair.

(3) The user might command a turtle in draw-mode to draw in different
colors and over the screen.  Since many distinct tiles would be
created, this would use a lot of "ink".

Depending on what she has chosen to draw, the user might eventually
either run out of "ink" (that is to say, tiles) or colorpairs (that is
to say, colortrays).

If the problem is no more "ink," an error message

NO MORE INK -- USE DISPLAYTILES COMMAND

might flash. If the user then typed

.ce
1DISPLAYTILES

0the present screenful would disappear into the buffer and the tiles
would be arrayed according to some numbering system on the screen.  Byu
using the command FLUSHTILE the user could simply eliminate some tiles!
Or she could use CHANGETILE to say, eg., 

.ce
1CHANGETILE [100 150]

0which would replace Tile #100 with Tile #150.

If the problem were no more colortrays an error message

NO MORE COLORTRAYS -- USE DISPLAYTRAYS COMMAND

might flash.  By typing

.ce
1DISPLAYTRAYS

0the present screenful would go into the buffer and the colortrays
could be shown.  Colortrays might then be flushed or chan
