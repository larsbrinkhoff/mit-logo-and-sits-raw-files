COMMENTS ON MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE MUSIC BOX

When I first heard about the music box, I was extremely
excited by the way it might bridge the gap between the
formal reporesentation of music and music theory and
practical music-making.  My first encounter leads me to
doubt whether LOGO music, as presently set up , will be
either accessible or exciting to Lamplighter kids. I have
discussed what I see as deficiencies around the lab and
there seems to be some agreement.  It also appears tha fixes
would be easy, although it would obviously require
commitment of some time on the part of someone.  These are
the problems I see:

1.  There is nothing built into the system that is analogous
to moving the Turtle around on the screen outside the
process of defining a procedure.  That is to say, typing and
getting sounds.  There is no direct way, then, to develop an
intuitive feel for the formal representation.

2.  The represenbtational system I was introduced to is
asyntonic:  it is terrible to have to type negative numbers
to get pitches below whatever pitch corresponds to 0 (it's
around middle C).  Much better, I think, would be setting
things up so that more keys could be used.  Problem would be
that keys could not be labelled mnemonically.  Is it
possible to manufacture caps to be placed on the keys?  I am
not sure what should be on them, i.e. whether there isn't
something attractive about using a system of formal
representation of pitches that is not so inextricably linked
to the tonal system as would be, e.g. a, a sharp, b, c ...
and the use capital letters and letters with a prime symbol.
But having to count backwards from middle C is awful and
builds in a bias against anything below the upper ranges of
a tenor voice.

3.  It would be great if the computer could show a staff,
let the user choose a clef, and show the pitches on the
staff.

These changes would make it easy for a child to debug wrong
notes out of a melody, to play with composing melodies, etc.

4.  Of course, it would be nice to have some real time
system, so that the user could tap out on some key:
     
     dotted quarter note
     sixteenth note
     eighth note
     eighth note
     half note

in, say, 2/4 time, and have the computer show

     3
     1
     2
     2
     8

Although maybe you couldn't show rests (they could all be
staccato notes), this would still be a big advance.

Problem is real time and fact that real musical rhythm is
not even close to metronomic.

5.  Some way to do solfeggio with computer, i.e. to sing a
pitch and have computer evaluate it.

These last two point, I think, are less crucial (and less
easily  realizable) than the first three, but perhaps are
interesting to think about for the future.
