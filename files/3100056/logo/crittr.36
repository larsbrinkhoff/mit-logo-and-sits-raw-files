Basic Setup for critterworld

    Critterworld consists of a bunch of objects called critters, which are instances of
OBJECT-CLASS.  There can be many species of critters, each of which is distinguished by
its RULES, which are a series of conditional forms that determine how a member of that
species interacts with the rest of the world.  These rules are read and acted upon each
time a critter updates itself.  This happens each time a critter gets an :UPDATE
message from the Ticktockman, a critter who acts as a continual, rotating wakeup
service for all of critterworld.  There can be can be sub-species, sub-sub- species,
and subn-species, of critters. (I suppose we could broaden our taxonomic scheme, if it
looks necessary.  Perhaps we could leave this to the kids.)  A sub-species has all of
the rules of its parent species, with perhaps some more, and possibly also some new
capabilities. One very important family (there--a new taxon!) of critters is that of sprites.
Sprites are critters with a picture, which can move about on the screen. Sprites can of
course have the null picture.

Conditionals--WHILE is while something is happening, WHEN is when something happens--"do
              action once when so and so occurs."  (WHILE near cat, scurry the other
              direction)  (WHEN near mouse, eat him)

WHILE       (WHILE condition action1 action2 ..)
WHEN         ditto				


Events--Most or all can be WHILE or WHEN.
:AGE= n
:MOVE-HEADING= n
:MOUSE-BUTTONS clicked
:TOUCHING                                 Is fast--"Do picture arrays (rectangles) overlap?"
:SPECIES-TOUCHING species-name            Sends :TOUCHING to each member of the relevant
                                          species-list, which is documented below.
					  
:DISTANCE critter1 critter2 <n            This takes more time than :TOUCHING.
:SPECIES-DISTANCE species 
					   If we want to have areas, distinct from critters,
					  (I think so--they'll have almost no moving parts)
					  then we need an--
:OVERAREA area					  


Actions--
:MOVE heading speed				;note the assymetry between args to
:JUMP-TO x y &opt speed				;:MOVE and to :TURN . The analogous format 
:TURN  angle &opt omega				;would be :MOVE heading distance &opt speed.
:TURN-TO heading 
:SPIN omega
:DISAPPEAR
:REAPPEAR
:CREATE-INSTANCE species-name &opt etc.
:CHANGE-TO other-species &opt etc.
:MAKE-SOUND note-list
:GO-AWAY  (for good)                                                   
:SCORE-POINTS etc.
:PAINT etc.

;;;All the critters we use will be sub-classes of CRITTER-CLASS (or sub-sub-classes, etc.),
;;;called species.  When we create a new species, say "krazy", using MAKE-NEW-SPECIES (right
;;;below),1) KRAZY-CLASS is defclass'd,2)two empty lists, KRAZY-LIST and KRAZY-NAME-LIST, ARE
;;;created, and 3) a :BORN message for KRAZY-CLASS is defmethod'd. When a new instance
;;;of KRAZY-CLASS is brought into the world, using CREATE-INSTANCE, her :BORN message
;;;gives her the picture-array and rules which we gave to  MAKE-NEW-SPECIES, and adds her
;;; to KRAZY-LIST and her pname to KRAZY-NAME-LIST. This last is for the benefit of us
;;;poor non-numerically-oriented dieties.
