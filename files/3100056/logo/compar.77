1I. A Comparison of the Work of Deborah and Donald:  Two Heads Are
More Interesting Than One
.br
0Deborah and Donald, students in two different classes both carried
out similar projects.  Both students made the computer draw a picture
of a head.  Deborah's was a "rabbit", Donald's a "man with a beard".
Both projects involved the use of subprocedures and superprocedures,
and both projects took several classes to complete.  Both used
subprocedures to draw the different features of the head, and both
students used a method which combined advance planning of the overall
design, with a trial and error approach to work out the details.

The two drawings, and the superprocedures used to draw them are shown
in Figure C-1.

Although the similarities between outcomes of the two projects is
clear, the two projects were carried out in strikingly
different ways.  Donald wrote out his superprocedure, HEAD, when he began
work, and defined each subprocedure as he went along.
Deborah's superprocedure was written last, after
all of its elements had already been defined.  Donald had clear
functional names for each of his subprocedures, while Deborah's naming
was inconsistent.  Deborah had an excellent intuitive grasp of which
inputs to use for FORWARD and RIGHT and LEFT commands to draw the
features of her rabbit, while Donald had a poor intuitive sense of
Turtle Geometry, and relied largely on mathematical analysis to draw
each of the features of his head, Donald absorbed a lot of new ideas in
mathematics, computer programming and problem solving, while Deborah
relied mainly on soldifying ideas with which she was already familiar
before she started her project.  These differences will now be examined
in more detail.

11. Planning and the Use of Superprocedures
.br
0Donald and Deborah each began with a drawing of how they expected
their finished project to look.  Once they had drawn a picture, each of
them made an initial attempt to have the computer draw the entire figure using direct
commands.  Once they saw that this was too large a task for them to
accomplish in a single procedure, each of them was shown how to carry
out the project more easily by making use of subprocedures.

Donald began by writing his superprocedure, TO HEAD, in a way that included
most of the significant details that he planned to include.  In this
way his superprocedure itself became a specific "plan" for the project he
was attempting to carry out.

Deborah, on the other hand, carried her plan in her head.  She 
defined different subprocedures as she went along, thus dividing
the larger project into more managable chunks.  Her superprocedure, TO
RABBIT, was written last, after her entire rabbit head had been built.
RABBIT includes both subprocedures and a large number of direct
commands which Deborah used to draw the rabbit's ears.
Although RABBIT causes the computer to draw the rabbit, it does not
provide an easily readable "plan" of the project.

12. The Naming of Subprocedures0
.br
Donald's subprocedures were consistently named according to the part of
the head that they drew.  The only exception was BOX which was used to
draw the outline of the head.  Some of his sub-procedures had names that
told how they "worked".  STRING, drew one "hair" of a beard; LBOX made
a box of variable size; POLY drew a polygon.  Others had functional
names:  HAIRY drew one "hair" of a head of hairs and EAR drew one ear.

Deborah's naming was much less consistent.  In some cases she was able
to think of an appropriate name for a subprocedure.  In other cases she
picked something else that came to mind.  Her procedure HAT drew the
outside of the rabbit's face.  LITTLEEYES drew the eyes -- it got its
long name because Deborah already had a different procedure called EYES.
NOSE made the rabbit's nose out of two arcs, but the procedure which
moved the turtle from where LITTLEEYES finished, to the center of the
face, and drew the nose was called FACE.  The procedure EARS
drew only on of the rabbit's ears.  Only one of Deborah's
subprocedures, FACE, contained a sub-procedure, NOSE, within it.

13. "Intuitive" vs. "Analytic" Approach to Turtle Geometry
.br
0Deborah was able to make use of a powerful visual intuition in
making designs with the turtle.  In her earliest experimentation with
inputs to turtle commands, she limited herself to multiples of ten, and
eventually came to use certain numbers, especially 30, 60 and 90, much
more often than others.  This strategy enabled her to create a number
of successful designs.
For example, a rotation of 60 degrees was a perfect first choice for
drawing a six-pointed star.  By repeating a fixed rotation such as
RIGHT 30, a number of times, Deborah was able to make a variety of
angles including 90, 180, 270 and 360 degrees.  By using a
"useful" set of limited numbers, Deborah was able to avoid analysis and
planning which were difficult for her.  She "knew" that if she repeated
RIGHT 30 often enough, she could get the turtle to go wherever she
wanted it, and could solve all her problems by experimentation, without
having to remember that 90 degrees makes a "right angle" or that 180
degrees turns the turtle to face in the opposite direction.  Similar
effects were obtained with FORWARD steps.  Deborah made a square of
side 120 by repeating FORWARD 90 FORWARD 30.  Later, she could easily
find the center of the square using FORWARD 30 FORWARD 30.

Deborah never consciously articulated the strategies she used for
choosing these particular inputs for turtle commands, or for solving
problems like "turning the turtle all the way around" by repeating a
series of RIGHT 30 commands.  She seemed to have an intuitive sense of
what would "work" rather than a conscious "plan".

Donald, on the other hand, had very poor results when he tried to solve
problems in turtle geometry by experimentation and visual evaluation of
the results.  He could estimate a distance or rotation, but his results
were often "just a little off," and he had difficulty making the small
corrections necessary.  Donald had a good understanding, however, of
careful analytic planning.  He knew that the distance across his square
was 100, and that half way was 50 and one quarter of the way was 25.
He could use this information in planning the location of features of
his head.  He could make use of the fact that the RARC procedure
rotated the turtle through a total angle of 90 degrees, to assist him
in figuring out how to position the turtle in order to draw a mouth on
his face.  Although he had problems when he tried to use "geometric
intuition" to carry
out his project, a combination of analysis, planning and
experimentation allowed him to be successful.

14. The Learning of New Ideas
.br
0Before she started working on her rabbit, Deborah had already made
use of most of the techniques she was to use in carrying out her
project.  She had already developed the strategy of relying heavily on
inputs of 30, 60, and 90 for FORWARD, RIGHT and LEFT commands.  She
had also begun to use subprocedures as building blocks in her FLOWER
and STAR procedures.  Her major learning during the course of the
project represented a consolidation of those ideas and the
understanding that a large complex project, whose details could not be
known in advance, could be carried out in a step-by-step fashion using
the approaches with which she was already familiar.

Donald, on the other hand, acquired a great deal of new skills and
knowledge, while working on his head project.  He learned
the
use of superprocedures and top-down planning; the use of geometrical
analysis to solve problems of detail, breaking problems into sub-parts;
and the use of sub-subprocedures within procedures to carry out
particular parts of the tasks involved.  In addition he learned to use
variables to control size and direction; to write procedures that
repeat a small module over and over; to use a conditional stop rule in
a repeating procedure; and to make use of circle and arc procedures.
He was comfortable working toward a long range goal which required many
skills that he did not possess, confident
that he could acquire them along the way as needed.
