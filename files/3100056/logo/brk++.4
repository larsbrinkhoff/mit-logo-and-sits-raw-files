Theme 4

Occasionally a visitor to a LOGO class will say: But they are just
drawing pictures, can't they do anything else? Other visitors are
impressed  in the opoosite way by the extraordinary diversity of 
what the students are doing. In our view the impression of great diversity
is more accurate and this study has led to an even deeper appreciation
of how great the diversity really is. Even when two students end up with
very simlar products, even a superficail glance at the process shows that
there is no sense in which they "just did the same thing". The data
from the project has yielded some very fine examples of converghence of
differnt processes and has contributed to further work on classifying
intellectaul styles. We see this as extremely important both for
theoretical psychology and for the developemnt of strategies for
teaching and learning.

The mostvstriking dichotomy of styles one sees in a  LOGO environemnt
is that computer programmers would refer to as "bottom up" vs "top down"
programming. The top down programmer is a planner. He starts with a
claer model of an end result . His first step is to translate this
into a program whose details are left balnk but whose structure has been
fixed from the outest. Among our students the extreme case was Donald who
worked steadily to turn the hand-drawn face into a computer prpogram
that drew a face remarkably like it. Over a period of ten sessions
Donald worked to fill in the gaps in a program that had  taken this
form by the ** session:
TO HEAD



@@@@@  FILL IN DONALDS PROGRAM AND PICTURES




END

Deborah alsomproduced a face. A glance at the drawings will show
immediately that she was following a very differnt process. For her
the final result was allowed to emerge as she proceeded. Following
Levi-Strauss Bob Lawler has proposed to call Deborah a "bricoleur"
or tinkerer. A cerytain well established intellectual tradition tends to
look down on the style of the bricoleur and see the obsessional planner
as the model to follow and impose of children. Research by Lawler and
others at M.I.T. as well as the results found in the Lincoln study indicate
that the style of bricolage may be much more natural and much more
productive than is usually admitted. Certainly we are convinced that
the turning point in Deborah's develoipemnt in the LOGO group came when
the teacher found a way to let her feel supported  in  developing an
extreme form of bricolage in her work.
