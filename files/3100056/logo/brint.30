1Analysis of Interview Data

0In order to gain information about transfer of the skills and
concepts involved in the students' LOGO experiences, we devised a
pre/post interview including several tasks which might shed light on
such transfer.  While this work is still in a fairly primitive stage,
we believe that our analysis of the interview data indicates some clear
gains made by the students as a result of the LOGO experience.  In this
section we describe four of the tasks which were presented to the seven
students in our Spring classes, and analyze the gains made by the
students.  Results are shown in table 1.@@@.

Task 1 involved estimation of length.  The students were asked to
compare a given line with five other lines drawn in various
orientations, and to draw three horizontal lines of their own (Figure
1.1)  This task should provide information about gains made in
estimating distances in the LOGO environment.  (Chapter 5, Section 2.2)

The eighth student, Tina, was unable to perform these tasks in a
consistent manner, or she performed them in a way that we have been
unable to understand.

Task 2 involved estimation of angle, and was similar to Task 1, except
that the subject was not asked to draw any angles.  (See Figure 1.2)
This could provide information about gains made in estimating angles.
(Chapter 5, Section 2.3)

Task 3 involved combining a series of Forward and Back Steps.  Subjects
were asked to replace the series of steps by a single step.  (See
figure 1.3)  This could provide information about gains made in
understanding the group properties of number, as students learn to
combine TURTLE steps in carrying out LOGO projects.  (Chapter 5,
Section 3).

Task 4 was more complex, and involved drawing a line on three grid-like maps of
increasing complexity,  and giving directions to move from one point to
another on the grid.  (See figures 1.4 and 1.5)  This task could
provide information about how accurately subjects give directions,
whether they distinguish right from left in different orientations,
whether they can transfer visual information to verbal information, and
in some cases, how well they can recognize errors and debug them.  It
combines aspects of Turtle Geometry, and procedure writing and debugging.

The results of these tasks, for the seven students who attempts them,
are shown in Table 1.@@@.  The students are considered to have made
major improvement, slight improvement or no improvement.  An
interpretation of no improvement may indicate that the subject made
compensating errors, or that the subject performed exactly the same in
both pretest and posttest situations.  In many cases subjects who
showed no improvement carried out the tasks perfectly in both cases.
