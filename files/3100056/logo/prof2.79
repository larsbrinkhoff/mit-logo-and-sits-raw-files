Horse Project

12.  Betsy0

Betsy is a slow, methodical student who tended to work on long
projects, each lasting for a number of class periods.  Although she was
quiet, and rarely asked for help in her work, she responded well to
suggestions from her teacher and once having acquired a new idea she
was usually able to make use of it in different contexts.   Betsy is 
considered to be below average in overall academic ability.  Her most
recent achievment test scores place her in 32nd percentiel, when
compared to national norms.  Our presentation of Betsy's work focuses on
examples of her major projects.

11. Betsy's Horse Project

0Betsy's first project was to draw a horse, using the computer.  In the
course of working on this project, Betsy learned to estimate angles and
distances with the TURTLE, to make use of 90 degree angles; to draw
rectangular shapes; and to make use of right/left reversibility.  In
the area of programming she learned to write procedures to use
subprocedures to draw different parts of her horse, and to write a
superprocedure to put the entire project together.

.adjust
Having already called one procedure LEG, Betsy chose a miscellaneous
name, SEE, for the second leg.  Since she used the same subprocedure to
move the TURTLE over, and to draw each feature, the same subprocedure LEG,
could not be used again to draw the second legs.

Geometric Designs

12.2  Geometric Designs Using Arcs

0Betsy spent six class periods making a series of designs with
quarter arcs.  She enjoyed the effect made by alternating left and
right arcs.  Her procedure, BOX, drew the largest series of four
alternating arcs that would fit on the screen without producing an "OUT
OF BOUNDS" message:

40 LARC 49		40 BOX
END			END

Her procedure, JIMMY, made the TURTLE retrace its steps so that it
returned to its point of origin.  When she repeated the same process
four times, to make a symmetrical design, KATHY, she gave each of her
four subprocedures a different name.  At this point she followed the
same pattern of subproceduralization that she had in her horse project:
each part of the design had its own function, and hence its own name.
While she was consciously repeating the same process four times to
make the overall design, she was not yet comfortable with the idea of
repeating the same procedure four times -- although that had been
suggested by the teacher.

Betsy's next design was made after a period of experimentation with
repeating BOX, rotation, BOX, rotation, ...  This time she made a
subprocedure, RAY, consisting of BOX and a rotation, and found that
repeating RAY nine times produced a "sun".

.adjust
Lines 10-50 of SUN are needed to move the TURTLE over so that the
entire design appears on the screen.  The design is drawn by line 60:
REPEAT [RAY] 9.

Next, Betsy wanted to make suns of different sizes.  She learned the
syntax for using variables, and rewrote her procedures:

.nofill
.block 6
TO BOX2 :SIZE	TO RAY2 :SIZE	TO SUN2 :SIZE
10 RARC :SIZE	10 BOX2 :SIZE	10 REPEAT [RAY2 :SIZE] 9
20 LARC :SIZE	20 LEFT 180	END
30 RARC :SIZE	30 RIGHT 20
40 LARC :SIZE	END
END

.adjust
Having defined a variable sun, Betsy set out to make a "sky" full of
stars.  Her design was limited to two stars, by the memory limitations
of the display computer.  Betsy's superprocedure, BUD, which draws the
sky, uses the subprocedure SUN2, twice.

Recursive Projects
.block 5
12.3  Recursive Projects

0For a few periods, Betsy experimented with randomly creating
geometric designs by using recursion.  ABC and SWING were two designs
which she liked well enough to make printed copies:

.nofill
.block 25
TO ABC		TO SWING
10 FORWARD 90	10 FORWARD 50
20 RIGHT 90	20 LEFT 40

50 LEFT 180	END
60 FORWARD 40
70 LARC 20
80 ABC
END

This led rather naturally to making a series of designs using POLY, and
exploring the relation betweeen the angle inputs to POLY, and the
resulting shape.  These explorations, and designs made using POLY
occupied another few classes.

Debugging a Person
.block 5
12.4  Debugging a Person

0Near the end of the series of classes, Betsy was asked to debug a
set of deliberately buggy procedures, designed to draw a person.  She
was faced with the problem of debugging a set of subprocedures which
drew a figure like this:

.block 15
.sp 13
.ce
Figure 2.8

Betsy had no difficulty getting the arms oriented correctly.  She did
have difficulty positioning the TURTLe to draw the head, however.
Rather than make use of the standard "fix" of rotating the turtle 90
degrees before drawing the head.  Betsy used a more elaborate process
of moving the TURTLE upward and to the left before starting to draw the
head.
