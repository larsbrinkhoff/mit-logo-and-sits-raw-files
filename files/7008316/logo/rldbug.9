1Microcultures and Learning0

^^^^^^^^^^Men have argued long over the relative influence in mental development of nature and nurture.  This seems a reasonable way to divide the factors influencing the development oif mind, for surely people differ from one another and experience must shape the mind.  And yet, such a way of cutting up the worlkd of mind has not been fruitful in revealing the mechanisms of mind's development.  The following simile may illuminate what I am getting at.  When you cut a grapefruit perpendicularly to the core, the cut face shows a pattern like a wheel with axle, spokes, and rim.  A little energy and perserverance are all you need to dig out and enjoy the juicy meat from between the spokes.  What happens if you halve a grapefruit the other way, along the core^? It is nearly impossible to get at the still buried meat, for the tough skin of the sections is an intact impediment.  THe point of the simile is this.  However reasonable it seems a priori to cut up the influences on mind along the nature-nurture pole, one musty judge the cutting by whether or not it is fruitful.  It is time to try a different cut.

^^^^^^^^^^I conceive of experience as less naturally divisible domains of subject and object than into a fundamental trichotomy.  These three aspects of the world I name as follows.  MY-WORLD is the personal and idiosyncratic world of the mind, self-constructed by the individual as he confronts his interpreted experiences.  OUR-WORLD is the social world, the domain of communicating intelligences.  THE-WORLD is the physical world, the world of things and their relations.310  I do not propose to deal at once with the entire mind, only with small parts of the mind I refer to as MICROWORLDS.  This terminology implies a commitment to the description of knowledge as inhering in a multitude of discrete and more or less disparate packets.  With a preliminary commitment to discrete knowledges, the central issue becomes describing their organization and communication.  MICROCULTURE is a term conjunctively applied at a comparable small scale to our-world and the-world.  Although I rarely discuss the elements separately, microsodality and miniworld may be taken to name the distinguished aspects of our-world and the-world at this same scale.  More specifically, a MICROSODALITY is a fellowship or society of parts of various minds as they interact and relate to a specific miniworld.  The term MINIWORLD refers to a relatively well-delimited aggregation of classes of things and their relations.  An outstanding example of such a miniworld in the "blocks world", a simple domain popular during the l970's in vision and linguistic research at MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.  The idea of a miniworld is important because it captures a point of view about the mind's understanding of reality.  If minds are organizations of disparate, active structures, reality can only be comprehended as a system of miniworlds.  This view plunges us intoa new way of examing the ipact of culture on a mind, for we can ask "What miniworlds does a microculture emphasize^?" and "How does the microculture shape learning about those miniworlds and their interrelations^?"  Let us address this latter question now with the help of a specific example.

^^^^^^^^^^At one critical juncture in her learning of addition, my daughter Miriam spontaneously asked her brother Robby "What is fifty plus fifty-three^? (Confer Lawler, 1980).  His answer was the datum around which she re-organized her thought.  Notice that Miriam's question was not externally "motivated"; she was reflecting on the objects of her thought.  During this reflection, she called upon Robby for advice.  The partial sharing of perspectives and concerns which gives one person access to another person's knowledge is the productive core of a microculture.  A MICROCULTURE is further definable as a cluster of problem classes to which a set of related perspectives and procedures may be applied.  The microculture is the set of problems driving development of potentially connectible microworlds within individuals' minds.  (Thus one person may be in several microcultures at one time.)  What holds the microculture together in the knowledge of procedural application among the cognoscenti.  The microculture is a consequence of what a group of people have discovered and remembered about problems encountered.  The relation of a learner as initiate to a microculture depends upon two different factors.  First is the richness of the problem set encountered.  In Miriam's introduction to Turtle Geometry through the Shoot procedurtes she came into a rucher microculture of calculation than her peers typically encounter.  The second factor is the effective intrusiveness of other microculture members.  Thus a learner may suffer the impression of an instructor's ideas, the gadfly's persistent sting, or if the power be his he can merely turn to others for advice at need.  These three then comprise the learning triad opf a microculture: a cluster of problems potentially connectible; a learner who will develop perspectives and procedures for coping with those problems; and the knowledges of other minds as applicable to the problems.

^^^^^^^^^^There are two paths through which the microculture influences the learner.  Giving advice is one way the cognoscenti can make their knowledge available.  But there is a corresponding problem, that of TAKING ADVICE, the learner's being able to interpret what someone else says with th effect that it leads to insight. Based on the observations and arguments of [* RLPROM >*] we conclude that taking advice is very difficult; and giving advice, though it can be strikingly effective in specific circumstances, is often vain.  The primary effect of a microculture must then come from the miniworlds which it emphasizes.  We go on from here to examine in detail Miriam's experience of programming at the Logo project of MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Her experiences of programming, unusual at the time but of a surely more common sort in the future, comprise an opportunity to examine how a particular microculture (which fell entirely within my purview) affected the development of a specific mind.  The programming microculture is one that takes on special significance in light of the following speculations about the interplay of systems of congitive structures.

1The Systematicity of Thought0

^^^^^^^^^^The point of this discussion is to sharpen our appreciation of the potential impact of computer experiene on thinking and ultimately, therefore, on the minds which construct themselves from their thought processes.  I choose to focus on potential increases in the systamticity of thought.  Piaget recognized and discriminated between the typical systematicity of adolescent thought and the lack thereof in children under twelve.  Since heraised the issue to prominence, it is natural to couch discussion in terms of Piaget's conceptions.  This makes  me uneasy becuase I am less interested in arguing with Piaget than I am in developing a different position.  However much one would avoid arguing with Piaget or those who read his work with varying comprehension, one cannot ignore his terminology or the misconceptions our use may inherit.  We will first deal with the term "concrete" and then with the contrast of "stages" of thought.

^^^^^^^^^^It must be clear that noting the concrete quality of descriptions in no way implies the manipulation of simulacra in the mind.  Discussing a child's biuas toward particularity is comlicated by the confusion of "concrete" as used in the sense of "originating in one's personal experience" with a second sense of "concrete", based on the frequently observed value for children of representing their thought by physically manipulable objects.  The confusion is exacerbated by an unfounded corollary of this latter sense of concrete: that a child's thought manipulates objects in his mind that are like those he manipulates with his action.  To convince yourself that such a view can not possiblybe true, consider this simple analogy (I do not believe its simplicity is deceptive).  The manipulation of objects is useful to children in their thinking as crutches are useful to a crippled man.  If we see a person on crutches, would it not be ridiculous to think that his legs are like crutches^?  A person uses crutches because his legs don't work or because he has no legs at all.  Children may employ manipulable objects as aids in thinking because their perspectives are syngnostic, and the functions of their thought are frequently not trustworthy.  Concrete descriptions are no less descriptions than are abstract ones.  Concrete descriptions may be symbolic, i.e. unrelated to any particular objects.  For example, Miriam claimed that she knew how to divide and proffered this evidence, "Eight divided by eight is one."  What could be more symbolic than number names^?  This knowledge is particular as an example of division, but it is concrete precisely because it was rooted in Miriam's experience as the only "division" she knew.  The example was as much a concrete ur-concept as any could be.  (The limit is, of course, that the slots of this ur-concept are specified (by ancestral microworlds) as being variables for numbers.)  Concrete descriptions are particular and rooted in personal experience.  Instead of opposing formal and concrete operational thought, let me oppose systematic to circumstantial thought.  If we identify CIRCUMSTANTIAL THOUGHT as that which wanders only a little from concrete descriptions, the questions at issue remain the relation of systematic thought to descriptions and of the reflexivity of mind to both.  My stance (derivitive from Papert) is that cognitive structures are emergents of computational processes; more remote emergents of these processes are the behavioral manifestation of their interaction as "stages".  After focussing on the meaning of this stance, we will return to the question of how computer experience could intervene as a novel force in shaping the mind.

^^^^^^^^^^EMERGENCE names the process by which an order results in an emsemble from the interaction of its parts.  Emergent effects can be quite surprising where the new order of the emseble appears consequent to a small cvhange in its relation of parts.  Consider, for example, the emergence of a crystal from a supersaturated solutioon upon a small decrease in temperature.  The non-linearity in the realtion of cause to effect is what makes emergence attractive as an explanation for the surprising capabilities of mind; the saltation of effects, which can finally only be understood by a close analysis of part interaction, makes the use of the idea risky.  The idea of emergence has a bad name as an explanation because so often it has been accompanied by hand-waving and the mysterious appearance of conclusions.  Aware that any critical reader will be suspicious, I will try to be especially lucid so what I mean is clear, even if not coercive.

^^^^^^^^^^Let me describe, as an example of how major characteristics of cognitive organization can be imagines to emerge from the interaction of aprts, my point of view about Piaget's stages.  We focussed in The Progressive Construction of Mind (Lawler, 1980) on two processes effecting the development of structure in the mind, the elevation of control and the correspondence of perspectives.  These structure generating processes also have functional implications in that the resulting structures represent different kinds of knowledge.  Let me name PARTICULAR KNOWLEDGE the first of four categories and exemplify it this way.  If you have a quarter and you know that a five-pack of gum costs 15 cents and lollipops a nickel each, you can dominate the corner of your life that involves deciding how to spend your money.  GENERAL KNOWLEDGE, as represented by the Serial and Bib-sums worlds, is a category of greater power.  Although it dfepends directly on the use of particular knowledge, its ordering is implicit knowledge about particular knowledge, and the greater power is a consequence of the assembly of subordinable knowledge.  CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE, as represented by the Conformal world, is also knowledge about knowledge.  In contrast with general knowledge, its power is a consequence of its perfective and corrective usefulness.

^^^^^^^^^^It would make no sense to claim that either general or constructive knowledge is the more powerful.  They represent diostinct, complementary aspects of the self-constructing mind.  The fourth category, EPISTEMOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE, is knowledge about knowledge about knowledge.  The idea that knowledge about knowledge is an especially powerful kind of knowledge exemplifies the fourth category.  Miriam has given no evidence in articulate expression of access to such a powerful idea, but there is a hint of interest in the genesis of ideas.  From such an interest and the appreciation of the role of structure in one's own mind, the fourth category could emerge.

^^^^^^^^^^Considering these categories of knowledge and the developmental sequence witnessed in this study, it is not unreasonable that investigations of development across a broad sample of minds should generate stage-like descriptions to cover average or typical patterns.  The selection of data relevant primarily to calculation is too narrow for an analysis to proceed or for the judicious assignment of correspondences.  Nothwithstanding, the concrete operational period may be viewed, speculatively, as a time during which the accumulation of particular knowledge has progressed to such a degree that under favorable circumstance the elevation of control can take place in various clusters of microworlds.  The attendent increase in power from generalization is a primary gain.  Because some clusters must develop to competent functioning before any gain would be possible from constructive use, it makes sense that the elevation of control might dominate learning in the early concrete operational period, by which time many competently functioning microworlds will have beenestablished.  When reflection permits the ramification of this knowledge to related worlds for their perfection, the secondary gain in functional power occurs.  As the process of reflection begins to operate betweenclusters of clusters of microworlds -- such as the Conformal/Serial/Big-sums triad and some other other cluster of clusters, connecting them into an even more embracing organization -- we could view the mind as crossing the threshhold to the period of formal operations.  This description comprises a PYRAMIDAL VISION of the overall structure of mind.

^^^^^^^^^^This speculative correspondence between the learning processes of The Progressive Construction of Mind and Piaget's stages serves to exemplify precisely how it is possible yo imagine that characteristics of the mind emerge from computational processes.  Notice that although the emergent organizations may "appear" or come into being suddenly as witnessed in behavior, that appearance marks a change in the balance of previously existing structures brought out by the cumulative operation of long functioning processes.  That is, if Miriam should begin tinking in a characteristically formal way at the age of twelve (or ten or even eight), the correspondence of perspectives is a process has still been witnessed functioning years before that (still expected) development.  If stages are not maturational consequents but statistically robust emergents from the interaction of long functioning processes, those stages may be subject to significant modification if factors affecting those processes change.  One may conceive of computer experience as having the potential for changing Piagetian stages through modifying the balance between structures achieved throughthe elevnation of control and those achieved through reflection.  But to argue strenuously for such a claim is to admit that stage theory is the most useful way to conceive of the developing mind.  I do not believe it is.  What is wrong with Piaget's stage theory is it's focus; specifically, its being a pyramidal vision.  As he warns everyone, hisd theorizing is about the development of knowledge in the mind.  I concur that this is the right point of view to have about the mind, but Piaget's epistemological concern derives from and remains too focussed on explaining how necessarily true logico-mathematical knowledge can develop through contingent experience.  This concern, however profound and fecund (and so I hold it to be), basically has distorted Piaget's theory of mental structure by overvaluing the dimension of abstraction and reflection at the cost of undervaluing proximate extensions of knowledge.  The nucleation of microworld clusters, introduced in [*rlprom >*] as a third major process of learning, broadens the issue of developing organization so that the question of a mind's systematicity can be seen to involve more than increasing reflexivity (although that remains a central point).

^^^^^^^^^^A cluster of microworlds is all the related knowledge in a mind about some portion of the world, i.e. a miniworld.  Knowledge about the mind itself is not different in kind from other knowledge.  It is special, and especially powerful, because it is reflexive, i.e. because it applies differently.  The late development of knowledge about the mind as an object, (that is the mind as a miniworld) occurs for at least three reasons.  First, the mind is most intangible (how much more so even than displacement volume).  Second, examining the processes of thought is not generally an important concern in most microcultures (however much their evaluation may be important).  Finally, there is a paucity of adequate public descriptions of mind.  The potential importance of computer experience to the developing mind turns on this last factor, and here is rooted in our speculation about the systematicity of mind.  Programming computers engages people in the procedural description of actions.  This procedural description does three kinds of things.  First, actions are specified.  Further, the control the controlsequence of their execution is specified.  The third aspect is that the controlled-action sequence is named.  The computer learns what a name means when an executable procedure has been defined for that name.  Knowledge of programming can become a concrete archtype and inform a person's knowledge about his own thoughts.  If this experience occurs when people are young, it will influence profoundly how they construct their minds.  Call this the STAGE RECONFIGURATION CONJECTURE.  Would the impact be for better or worse^?  Judgments which sum to a single word are hard to make -- and harder to evaluate without a rich experience.  Let me defer the details of my opinion, a positive one, for a while.  Setting aside this question of judgment, we must still confront the question of whether this speculation is a technician's fantasy or a possibility of such import or likelihood to demand its being taken seriously.

^^^^^^^^^^If we argue that some experience may have a profound effect, we should specify precisely what aspect of the experience engages a powerful idea and in what sense that idea is unnatural.  The central idea that can from programming experience is the IDEA OF ANALYSIS, the division of something into parts for the examination of the parts themselves, their interrelations and their relations to the whole.  I consider the unnaturalness of analysis an empirical observation, one which has been witness extensively in [*rlprom>*].  If thought is experience as a cascade of demon activations, the analysis is unnatural in thesense of being remote from current popular visions of mind.  Further, analysis can be seen as unnatural, with respect to circumstantial thought (i.e. thought based on concrete descriptions) because it is retrograde to the elevation of control, the primary process through which circumstantial thought develops.  (We will return to this theme in the body of this paper.)  If programming is held out as a concrete experience through which children will come earlier to an accessible experience of the idea of analysis, must I not argue that procedural description is an adequate description of the mind^?  I do.  But that is ridiculous^!  Even though we view the mind as a pandemonium, without making strong claims about the reality of procedures in the brain, we have been able to use pro edural descriptions to illuminate the processes of thought in The Progressive Construction of Mind [* * ].  Adequate means "good enough" and that always implies comparison to a requirement or predecessor.  The idea of analysis appears in programming in the guise of "debugging".  DEBUGGING is the diagnosis of a procedure's failure and the repair of the procedure to avoid the failure in future executions.  Debugging is a concrete form of analysis.  Contrast the view of mind as debuggable procedures with alternatives.  How do children think about intelligence^?  "He's a brain.  That one's a dummy.  I'm not mathematical-minded.  I can't spell at all."  These are simple judgments applied to complex behavior, prototypical faculty theories of mind.  How do children think they think^?  One answer: "Make your mind a blank and wait for an idea to come."  (This answer admits the competetive and interruptable character of heterarchical structure.)  The corresponding proscription for learning is "keep your mind a blank and say it over and over."  How do children respond to a learning challenge^?  Either "I got it^!" or "I don't get it."  This is primarily a report of a result, marking either the success or failure of assimilating a problem situation to existing knowledge, but it can also be interpreted as the precursor of a learning-through-insight theory.  In school, children suffer instruction; as one child put it, the don't learn, the "get teached", i.e. they are programmed.  If a child can see himself as a programmer, he can develop a vision of learning as self-programming and of himself as the agent of his own construction.  That is, the knowledge of programming could serve as an archtype and inform the cluster of microworlds whole corresponding miniworld is the mind itself.

^^^^^^^^^^If you grant there are tenable theoretical reasons for believing the experience of rpogramming could affect mental development profoundly, you may still legitimately inquire why twenty years of research into the effect of computers on education has shown no such dramatic impact.  My answer, an excuse of sorts repeatrs arguments advanced earlier [* *where am I going to put the WWI TANK story].  Studies of computers in education have asked, "How can we use computers to teach what we already know^?" instead of the strategic question "How can we learn from them what computers are best at showing^?"  The material of [*rlprom>] and this paper presents my attempt to pose the latter question and make sense of the consequences.  My general conclusion is that The Intimate Study has profoundly affected the development of both Miriam and Robby, and that in a way not harmful.  Miriam became unusually sensitive to procedural description, and articulate; and she came to hold the belief that she learned through teaching herself.  [* * strong conclusion needed to this section here].
