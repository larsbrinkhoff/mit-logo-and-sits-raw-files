Dear Elliot,

^^^^^^^^^^My viewpoint about "the role of experimentation in AI" derives from a position advanced by Minsky long ago in his Turing Lecture, "Form and Content in Computer Science" -- that computational ideas are a newly available resource applicable to describing the processes of thought.  That position has been carried further (as discussed by Laurence Miller in "Has Artificial Intelligence Contributed to an Understanding of the Human Mind^?", Cognitive Science, 1978, 2, 111-127) to the Minsky-Papert stance that a fundamental A.I. objective is developing  tools for describing complexly organized and interacting processes.

^^^^^^^^^^If we assert that A.I. is developing a kind of mathematics applicable to describing mind, as the calculus is a mathematics applicable to physics, the question of experiment's role clearly depends not on whether some scientist classifies himself as a psychologist or an A.I. person but on whether his objective in a particular labor is more mathematical or concrete (where I use the term in its sense of applying to the specifics of actual experience).  The calculus has an affinity with physics in the sense that it applies so well to the domian.  This is not an accident; the differential focus of the calculus developed through the endeavor to understand astronomy.  It is, nonetheless, an accident of physics that the differential is a central entity, dealing with which gives calculus its derivitive power as an applicable description of a reality.  Similarly, A.I. has an affinity with cognitive psychology because control structure specifically describes an organization of functioning information -- and what else can mind be^?  Calculus is not physics.  No more is A.I. Cognitive Psychology despite its affinity for it.
				
^^^^^^^^^^One may quarrel with the name of the discipline if it is used as a boundary beyond which ideas may not be applied. -- for instance, to argue that Artificial Intelligence can only be concerned with functioning information in entities not born but made.  There seems little danger that natural modesty will lead us to impose such an artificial restriction on our work.  On the contrary, the bold claim has been advanced that the end of A.I. is a general theory of intelligence applicable to every sort of organization.  With a more modest claim, capable of substantiation, that we have learned a little about intelligence in two various forms, artificial and natural, I prefer the label Variform Intelligence  to any more grandiose title.  (The seriousness with which I take this argument is witnessed by my having specified that name for my interdisciplinary doctoral degree.) 

^^^^^^^^^^As for talking to the uninitiated, I am willing to call myself a scientist.  When asked, "What kind^?", I reveal the etymological pun in my use, that I am not merely one who uses knowledge and believes in its power but am one who studies its function and structure in whatever embodiments of mind there be.  My interlocutor's eyes usually begin to glaze as I hold forth on the distinction between knowledge and intelligence....and then we turn to some more popular issues such as the potential impact of computers on children's lives.
