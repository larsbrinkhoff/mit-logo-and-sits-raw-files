Justification and the issue of closure:
^^why present a collection of papers now rather than later or previously ?
^^1. project termination as justification....I see no such termination,
^^^^^though a metamorphosis, even a taking wing, might be a possibility.
^^2. much better: a new plateau in clarity from the establishment of microworlds
^^^^^as an engineering task for the education industry; the review of how this 
^^^^^idea developed is a way to exemplify the idea itself -- the best way.
^^3. who would do the work ?  how would the book take shape ?
^^^^^a. I would function as editor and as factor; this would involve my
^^^^^^^^writing an introduction, selecting (with consultation) papers from
^^^^^^^^the Logo archives (however limited they in fact are), requesting
^^^^^^^^revisions (minimal) and coping with a publisher.  The purposes of
^^^^^^^^the introduction (with the title The Architecture of Interior Space)
^^^^^^^^would be to relate the various papers through the idea of microworlds and
^^^^^^^^to present through the papers a more detailed, albeit more primitive,
^^^^^^^^exposition of Logo ideas than Mindstorms.
^^^^^b. a typist would key current memo texts with emacs/R control characters;
^^^^^^^^to the extent any texts are online now, keying effort and expense could
^^^^^^^^be saved.  These texts would go to their authors, along with a copy of
^^^^^^^^the introduction.
^^^^^c. each article author would be expected to make any quality improvements
^^^^^^^^he chooses of limited scope (in light of the collection having a
^^^^^^^^historical as wellas programmatic focus).  Criticism of the introduction
^^^^^^^^would be solicited from each article author -- the reasons for this are to
^^^^^^^^make sure the introduction is as fair as possible and to draw on the better
^^^^^^^^ideas of others in this community.
^^4. prospective contents:
