1One Child's Learning:  Inventing Jokes0
.sp 25
1ABSTRACT0

^^^^^^^^^^This case study of one child's learning about jokes leads us to appreciate that punning is early evidence of the existence of a mental process of control which can hold simuiltaneously two incompatible significations.  A further example of applied joke-invention provokes us to propose that humor serves  a significant function in learning through the suppression of "wrong" ideas whewn better ones have been adopted.

0^^^^^^^^^^This is a simple story, invoking no expert theory of the domain of joke invention; neither psychoanalytic nor literary theories of wit and comedy are called upon.  We focus on learning about punning although other classes of jokes are exemplified as a background against which the knowledge of punning can be contrasted.  The observations recount the developing skill of one child, Miriam, my daughter, at understanding and inventing jokes.  Any prospective reader is right to ask why such material is worth his time.

          The invention of puns requires an ability to view one object simultaneously from different perspectives.  The development of this capacity is emerging as one of Miriam's central accomplishments during The Intimate Study (an intensive, naturalistic study of her cognitive development from 6;0 to 6;6) and is implicated in other skills she acquired, e.g. addition in the vertical form of the hindu-arabic notation.  As this story unfolds, we will exemplify what sorts of observations are required to understand that learning which derives from the interconnection and reorganization of knowledges in the mind.  If the methods I employ are more like natural history than "Science" and are vulnerable to criticism as subjective for their dependence upon naturalistic observation, they do at least confront directly the unschedulability of insight, the failure to deal with which has long impoverished the study of human learning.

          I can't think about learning in the abstract.  I need memorable examples of learning to help me think about the process.  The examples presented in the following text appeared over several years' time, but they are not merely  representative.  Even though they are sparse, these observations are reasonably complete, because inventing jokes has been a much praised activity in my home.  The claim is born out not only by the pride with which Miriam and her brother Robby exhibited their newly invented jokes but even more by their unconstrained willingness to make gross and vulgar jokes. (Readers easily offended may take this statement as a warning.)  Let us proceed through the following examples to see how Miriam came to invent puns and the significance of jokes in her learning.

1Background0
.fi b
          Puns comprise one class of jokes.  They must be distinguished from other kinds of jokes so interpretations  may tease apart the elements of humor witnessed by enjoying a joke.  At the age of six, three elements of humor dominated the jokes in Miriam's repertoire: contract-frustration, vulgarity, and insult.  Each of these terms can characterize a class of jokes even though they frequently appear in combination.

1Contractual^Jokes0

          Contractual jokes depend on the establishment and violation of shared expectations.  The first case is the most anti-social  in frustrating the expectations of the victim.  Those following merely impede acting out of the script jokester and victim accept.

          A short curriculum at table in my home has been one of telling jokes and, since the children's repertoire is quite small, listening to them retelling jokes told them.  The first, most primitive was:
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Jokester:^You know what^?
Victim:^^^What^?
Jokester:^That's what^!

.ls 2
.fi b
.in
How countless the times I've regretted introducing that joke to my children.  It apparently conveyed to them the idea that a joke is a verbal exchange as a consequence of which at least one person laughs.  When the joke fell under censure as a `tired old joke', Miriam tried variations (also condemned):
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Jokester:^You know something^?
Victim:^^^What^?
Jokester:^That's something^!

.ls 2
.fi b
.in

^^^^^^^^^^One development of this genre came by example from the children's encounter with syntactic rigidity of the Logo computer language interpreter(210).  That computer language facility will not execute any command given it until it  receives a "do it" signal, i.e. a carriage return or new line; nothing else will do.  As we trekked across the MIT campus, the children frequently played "Follow the Turtle".  This game differes from "follow the leader" in that the first child, actually leading, follows commands of the second.  Miriam, following Robby, gave him commands which directed him to turn and walk into a wall.  Robby stood quite still, with a very pleased smile on his face, as Miriam and I tried to figure out why he wasn't moving.  When I tried ending the game, Robby explained in the error message style of Logo and imitating the sound of our mechanical voice box, "You haven't done a carriage return".  When Miriam responded, "New line", Robby obliged her by walking into the wall.

^^^^^^^^^^I cite the foregoing as a clear example of the genre.  The puzzle setting element of this joke is similar to Miriam's query, "What's the magic word^?" which one must answer before she acquiesces in following some distaseful command.  Miriam's later use of Logo syntax and turtle geometry constraints integrate the contract impediment motif with the legalistic or syntactic quibble as the means.  A variation on the impediement form appears as making impossible demands.  One day Robby imitated a different kind of robot (not a turtle) -- one for blowing the dust of off newly sharpened pencils.  When Miriam sharpened the first of six pencils and held it up to examine the point, Robby blew the dust off.  Miriam commande, "Stop" and he did.  With the next pencil, at the appropriate time, Miriam commanded, "Blow"; he did:
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Miriam:^I'll push your thumb.  That will be your stop button...Blow.
Robby:^^(Blows on pencil and stops when Miriam presses his thumb.
^^^^^^^^He then rises and stands beside Miriam, holding up two thumbs --
^^^^^^^^one for starting, apparently.)
Miriam:^Hey.  Instead, this button can be for sort of running in place.
^^^^^^^^Your nose will be the start button.  (Miriam raises a pencil
^^^^^^^^before him and presses his nose.)
Robby:^^(Blows on pencil and runs in place.)
Miriam:^(Presses his "stop" thumb.)
Robby:^^(Stops.)
Miriam:^(presses "start", "stop", and "run in place" buttons all
^^^^^^^^at the same time.)
Robby:^^Arrgh !  How did I ever get mixed up in this ?

.in
.ls 2
.fi b
This joke functions by impeding a contract (in the specific case, one ephemeral as any could be).

1Vulgar^Jokes0

^^^^^^^^^^The preceding group of jokes tended to be less verbal than most "grown up" jokes.  The vulgar group of jokes tends to center on relatively forbidden words as the target of their execution.  Thus, even if active, as this first example which Miriam met at age five, they reduce to violation of some petty taboo.  Miriam acted out this four phrase joke taught her by a ten year old at her baby-sitter's house:
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
^^^^^Action^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Verbal Accompaniement
Fingers at the outer eye
^^corners, pulling upwards^^^^^^^^^^^^Chinese...
Fingers then pulling the
^^eye conrners down^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Japanese...
Hands down at the kneecaps^^^^Dirty knees...
Pulling out the front of
^^her blouse, one hand on
^^each side of her chest^^^^^^^^^^^^^What are these^?

.in
.ls 2
.fi b
Though the answer doesn't scan, "Boobies" was what Miriam expected any auditor to supply.

^^^^^^^^^^The first ` pun' Miriam appeared to comprehend she expressed near age five.  (This was long the only pun she recognized.)  Imagine the child reciting the English alphabetic litany (a,b,c,d/e,f,g/...)  Beginning with a finger pointing to her forehead, each letter brought it lower down the center of her body till the letter P placed her hand at her pudenda.  "Pee, Daddy, get it ?  Pee."  This homonymic obtrusion resurfaced later when I was asked to spell `Mississippi'.  My childhod chant went "M/Iss/Iss/Ipp/I" (where the capitals show greater quantity).  Thereafter I endured the expected rounds of "I pee pee, get it ?"  I dwell on this, despite its showing no commendable cleverness, because it is the first and central pun of Miriam's experience.  I suspect all these jokes are both latent and endemic in the common child cuilture.

^^^^^^^^^^Having seen a TV program about the flight of the Enola Gay over Hiroshima, the children asked me why the A-bomb had a special name, then whether or not there might be a B-bomb and so forth.  I explained as best I could the A-bomb and the H-bomb, that although there was no B-bomb there was a cobalt bomb that could be called a C-bomb.  When asked about the C-bomb, I noted it was especially damaging to people.  Miriam interrupted here with her invention of a bomb, the F-bomb, that wouldn't hurt people but would chase everybody away.  When she had our full attention, Miriam burst out laughing and said, "It's a fart bomb."

^^^^^^^^^^Why did Miriam find this funny ?  The fart bomb would obviously be good because it would not destroy things (we don't let children do that), would chase away bad people by confronting them with a threat worse than death (which, being entirely beyond Miriam's experience had no appreciable meaning for her).  And, of course, there is the petty taboo that farting and talk about farts is forbidden generally.  So much for her point of view.  The humor I find in Miriam's joke is that should she ever ask me what is a neutron bomb, I will be able to explain it to her as a more humane kind of fart bomb in that it kills without gross offense.  I consider her invention a witty surprise, distinct in kind from humor depending on contrasting meanings.

1Insulting^Jokes0

^^^^^^^^^^One of the early activities the children indulged in, when Miriam was four or five years old and we lived near the Connecticut turnpike, was shouting as our old sports car, a '53 MG, went through highway underpasses.  The chant that resolved itself as their favorite was "Daddy is a dumb-dumb."  This children apparently consider this a joke.  Chanting under bridges is something they long enjoyed, and they seemed to relish each occasion as a witness that theyweresurprising, even outwitting, their dumb old dad.  My speculation that the children believe an insult is the basis of much humor derives support from their early invention of jokes in the "knock-knock" form.  The proto-type, to which I introduced them, is this:
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Jokester:^Knock, knock.
Victim:^^^Who's there ?
Jokester:^Boo.
Victim:^^Boo who ?
Jokester:^Cry baby, cry.  Put your finger in your eye.

.ls 2
.fi b
.in
At their introduction to this joke, the children's reaction was profound non-conprehension.  The best illustration of Miriam's developing understanding -- in this case at age 5;6 -- comes from examining a joke she made up in imitation of the foregoing:
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Jokester:^Knock, knock.
Victim:^^^Who's there ?
Jokester:^Bobby.
Victim:^^^Bobby who ?
Jokester:^Booby you .

.ls 2
.fi b
.in
The appearance is that Miriam appreciated the joke as a verbal ritual which allowed her to attribute some undersireable characteristic to the victim, i.e. you are a booby.  Note also, the minimal change from "boo" to "booby".

^^^^^^^^^^After suffering a multitude of retellings of this joke, liberally spiced with repetitions of "You know what^?" I complained to the chilren their continuing would drive me to the booby-hatch.  I continued as jokester:
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Jokester:^Knock, knock.
Victim:^^^Who's there ?
Jokester:^Booby hatch.
Victim:^^^Booby hatch who ?
Jokester:^God bless you, Booby.

.in
.ls 2
.fi b
This variation was beyond Miriam's comprehension at 6;0.

.keep
1Characteristics^of^the^Basic^Categories0

^^^^^^^^^^The central characteristic of Miriam's early jokes is violation of a contract.  This obtains whether the motive to laughter be the impediment to shared expectations of a script or violation of conventions about acceptable topics of conversation.  A second characteristic, not previously exemplified, is Miriam's reluctance to tell (or retell) a joke she felt she didn't understand.  For example, Miriam was willing to retell this joke of Robby's:
.end_keep
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Jokester:^Knock, knock.
Victim:^^^Who's there ?
Jokester:^Telephone.
Victim:^^^Telephone who ?
Jokester:^Ding-a-ling.

.in
.ls 2
.fi b
I consider this funny for the implication that anyone who would string along in this tired old form is a ding-a-ling; I believe Miriam found it funny purely as a script for hurling invective.  Miriam did not retell the booby hatch joke until later.  The third and striking charcacteristic is the appearance of joke telling as a variation on a theme.  Recall how "You know what^?" became "You know something^?" and how "Boo who^?" became "Booby who^?"  A slightly more elaborate example is this imitation (first is Gretchen's joke, next Miriam's):
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Jokester:^Knock, knock.
Victim:^^^Who's there ?
Jokester:^Olive.
Victim:^^^Olive who ?
Jokester:^Ah luv you.


Jokester:^Knock, knock.
Victim:^^^Who's there.
Jokester:^Pickle.
Victim:^^^Pickle who ?
Jokester:^Pickle you.

.in
.ls 2
.fi b
Isn't is bizarre that a child, one probably unfamiliar with the idiomatic meaning of `getting pickled', should invent such a joke^?  I believe the only explanation is one of step-wise transformation wherein a pickle, seen as being like an olive (green, spicy, coming from a jar), merely occupies the olive's place.  This implies complete blindness to the pun and, in my interpretation, ascription of humor to the peculiar threat of turning a person into a pickle or asserting that he is somehow pickle-like.

^^^^^^^^^^This process of step-wise variation for generating new jokes appears most clearly in the development of the chant for passing under bridges.  Whenever we rode to MIT, Miriam had a standing request that we follow Memorial Drive through the underpass as Massachusetts Avenue.  When one day I preferred a different route to our lab, Miriam claimed she was so mad at me that she would quit my research project.  I complained to her: "Do you think I like to hear you shout that I'm a dumb-dumb^?  You always yell that.  Don't you think it hurts my feelings^?"  Later she confided, "Daddy, we really don't think you're a dumb-dumb.  But we like to shout under bridges and don't know anything else to say."  Over those following days when we did pass under Mass Ave, Miriam tried out these variations of the underpass chant:
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Daddy is a smart-smart.
Daddy is a smart-dumb.
Daddy is a dumb-smart.

.in
When she later asked Robby for advice, he offered this chant:

.in .5i
^^^^^Leader^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Respondent
Is Daddy a dummy ?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^No^!
Is Daddy a smarty ?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^No^!
What is he ?^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^An idiot^!

.ls 2
.in
.fi b
This is a relatively flexible variation on a short script for a shouting insult.  At the end of The Intimate Study, Miriam had apparently settled on the pale and bland cry, "Daddy is a nice guy."  (We all found it inadequate.)

^^^^^^^^^^The final notable characteristic is more of a micro-cultural observation than an interpretation.  Word play had a place in the life of our family, and more, invention was praised. Thus I am confident that both Robby and Miriam brought their inventions home.  They were, in effect, my colleagues and gathered the material which is the basis of this discussion.


1The^Circumstances^of^an^Insight

^^^^^^^^^^Miriam had never given evidence of understanding the knock-knock joke wherein the caller was "booby hatch".  On the last day of kindergarden, she came to do so.  I joined Miriam at school that day, something I did not infrequently.  Arriving early, I read one book to Miriam and those of her classmates who were present.  Miriam then produced a small book about a panda bear from China, Ah Choo.  I asked her to read it, and she did so.  The simple plot has the panda sneezing on every page.  At lunch the same day, Miriam began this dialogue:
.nf L
.ls 1
.in .5i
Miriam:^Knock, knock.
Bob:^^^^Who's there ?
Miriam:^Ah.
Bob:^^^^Ah whoo ?
Miriam:^No.  Choo.
Bob:^^^^Choo who ?
Miriam:^No. No.  Ach.
Bob:^^^^Ach who ?
Miriam:^God bless you.

.in
.ls 2
.fi b
Miriam thus clearly understood (and I believe came to understand through the mediation of the panda bear story and its joke) the knock, knock/booby hatch joke I had invented months before in response to her earlier insult.

^^^^^^^^^^What does one make of such a story ?  Note first that Miriam had been exposed to the "Hatch who" joke for over eight months before she reproduced it.  Her reproducing the joke followed within a few hours upon exposure to a book which explicitly distinguished between the name of the bear Ah Choo and the identical sound he made (with many illustrations).  The difficulty she had in expressing the knock knock joke shows clearly that she understood the pun in a different context (that of the panda bear book) and with that double perspective was retro-fitting her comprehension of the pun into the specific context of the knock-knock joke.  There is nothing vulgar, there is no word suffering a petty taboo involved in `Ah Choo'.  When the victim of the joke says "Ach who^?". he is vulnerable not to any direct insult but only to the indirect one of implied stupidity that he could not predict from the script rigidity and initial introduction the unintended meaning he is required to say.   This joke qualifies as Miriam's first complex pun (in contrast to P/pee).  

^^^^^^^^^^The blossoming of interest is evidence an insight had occured which permitted intelligent exploration of areas of experience.  After the Booby-hatch breakthrough, while helping a neighbor move, Robby and Miriam discovered a book of knock-knock jokes.  Of the many books about, they chose to read that one and brought to our luncheon table a series of jokes ( e.g.V: Robin who^?; J: Robbing you. Gimme your wallet.).  The crucial information this book revealed was that such books existed.  On their next visit to the library, one child borrowed a book of knock-knock jokes and the other a book of riddles.

^^^^^^^^^^After the joke books had been in the house a few weeks, when one day a few knock-knock jokes crossed the table, Miriam observed, "The thing that makes them knock-knock jokes is you have to say `Who's there^?' ".  We all agreed, then Miriam began what seemed a divagation:
.nf L
.in .5i
.ls 1
Miriam:^Knock, knock.
Robby:^^Who's there ?
Miriam:^Will you remember me in five years ?
Robby:^^I don't get it....I thought this was a joke.
Miriam:^(insistently) Will you remember me in five years ?
Robby:^^Yeah.
Miriam:^Will you remember in ten years ?
Robby:^^Oh, I guess so...
^^^(the conversation generally started drifting another way.)
Miriam:^(Interrupting) Knock, knock.
Robby:^^(A little exasperated) Who's there ?
Miriam:^(Looking right at Robby) Don't you remember me ?

.ls 2
.fi b
.in
This joke, which Miriam claims without reserve to have invented at that time, is especially interesting for the following reasons.  Its humor depends upon stereotypical script expectations and their violation at a discourse level.  As far as I can tell, it is a unique knock-knock joke in combing the contractual basis with an implicit insult ("You can't remember a thing") while omitting any verbal pun.  One does not have to believe Miriam invented this joke to notice how explicit was her earlier reflection on the structure as distinct from the contents of the knock-knock genre.

1Puns0

^^^^^^^^^^At age 5;6, Miriam stumbled into the P/pee confusion and thought it notable.  Is it a pun, in the midst of the orthographic/ linguistic chaos of the pre-reader's shifting understanding of language, to recognize homonymic confusion at the syllabic level ?(220).  No one can be certain what Miriam thought then.  Contrariwise, when the "hatch who^?" pun appeared, it was clear that Miriam was reworking what she realized earlier as an insight into experiences she had earlier suffered without understanding.  Late in The Intimate Study Miriam invented her first pun.  When she brought home report of her new joke, she mentioned none of the surroundings except victimizing Brian:
.nf
.ls 1
.in .5i
Miriam:^What should you do if your toe falls off ?
Brian:^^I don't know.
Miriam:^Call a tow truck.

.ls 2
.in
.fi b
We all thought her joke funny and marked it as a significant advance over her earlier "fart bomb" joke.  Miriam has been mute on the inspiration for the joke.  The script is primitive as can be -- an impossible question, so absurd as to be necessarily classed as a joke -- gets is helpless answer and the punch line.  The pun itself is simple: two concrete objects, both well within the child's experience, are held in absurd juxtaposition because of an accidental aural similiarity.  The particular form extended easily to this first joke, but Miriam rejected the second as "not very funny":
.nf
.ls 1
.in .5i
Jokester:^What should you do if you thumb falls off ?
Victim:^^^I don't know.
Jokester:^Get a thumb tack.


Jokester:^What should you do if you lose your head ?
Victim:^^^I don't know.
Jokester:^Call a head hunter.

.in
.ls 2
.fi b
The relative simplicity of the first absurdity compared to the second is obvious.

1Conclusions0

The^Significance^of^Punning

^^^^^^^^^^Piagetian psychologists have remarked that an infant's pretending -- for example, to be asleep -- is an early sign of transition from the sensori-motor period to the semiotic period.  The beginnings of verbal punning may likewise be taken as early signs of a child's engagement with the complexities of language which later might result in the conviction of necessary truth from the strength of an argument's form and the ability to solve Burt's riddle: "if Edith is darker than than Susan and Susan is fairer than Lilly, who is fairest of the three^?" (Piaget proffers these as criteria of formal thought.)  Punning is clear evidence, thought trivial in itself, of the capability of some mental process to span different worlds of reference and maintain control despite a serious threat of confusion.  Its development permits inferring the effective organization of an additional level of control in the mind.

The^Methodological^Significance^of^This^Story

^^^^^^^^^^This cameo raises a question central to the study of natural learning.  How can any student of mind cope with this intractable dilemma: the events which precipitate learning can not be scheduled (think of Miriam's reading the book about Ah Choo -- and how that was important mainly because it helped her make sense of particular, prior experience); such events may occur quite infrequently.  I chose to enlist the subject of the study as a researcher's agent, a colleague in fact (and depended for completeness of observation on her interest in the content and on her willingness to be open with me, to think out loud).  The coherence of this story, which spans two years though it focusses on a recent development, exhibits the level of detail to which one must appeal in tracing the specific incidents through which learning occurs.  Finally, the story shows this child, Miriam, and her learning in a new social light.  She carries concerns and unsovled puzzles from a central society, our family, to a peripheral environment, her kindergarden, where she employs whatever materials are at hand to solve those puzzles, from which she returns with the means to enrich that central society, the family.

.bp				
The^Use^of^Joke^Invention^in^Learning

^^^^^^^^^^During computer sessions at our laboratory, I introduced Miriam to debugging.(230)  Her behavior before learning how to analyse specific bugs can best be characterized as JUSTIFICATION when any bug became manifest.  For example, when confronted by a Lollipop procedure which drew a line (the stick) and a circle (the candy) not above and centered over the stick but off to one side, rather than figuring out how to fix the bug, Miriam excused the appearance by arguing that the lollipop was broken.  Through a number of exercises Miriam was introduced to setup and interface bugs.  With concrete experience of these bug classifications, Miriam was able to describe procedure failures precisely and thus generate fixes from her more precise descriptions of the bugs.  Consequently, we may see the debugging capability Miriam shows in the following example as a new addition to her reportoire of intellectual skills and we note emphatically that it conflicts with and is in competition with her earlier behavior of bug justification.

Bugs^in^the^PERSON^Procedure

^^^^^^^^^^The final phase of the PERSON project (one wherein Miriam encoded subprocedures [HEAD, BODY, ARMS, and LEGS] to draw a person) was an elaboratioon wherein Miriam added "hair" to the HEAD procedure.  While earlier drawing a FLOWER procedure, she at one point noted that the petals looked like curly hair and noted she could add face parts; thus this elaboration was not a new theme.  She selected the HEAD procedure as the one to modify and executed.  Unable to figure out how to insert curls on the turtle's first pass between the ears, Miriam chose to do so ona second pass by extending the HEAD procedure.  Tracing the outline of the head by repeatedly executing an arc-traversing procedure, she began commanding and coding "curls" into the HEAD procedure.  With one curl in place on the screen and encoded in the procedure, I asked Miriam to test the procedure.  When HEAD executed, a bug was manifest, a curl at the neck (see Figure 1).
.nf
.li 1
.in .5i
Miriam:^^Noooo! (Complaining, smiling)
Bob:^^^^^What's the matter ?...Oh, I see.  Hey!  We've got a bug there.
^^^^^^^^^I think it's sort of, must be a setup bug.
Miriam:^^Yeah.  We forgot to make the BUMPS that we bumped him up to the ear.
.li 2
.in
.fi b
The bug description is presented in analysed form which translates directly into a prescription for a fix, in contrast to an unanalysed description such as "he's got a curl on his chin."  Miriam added the remaining curls with no problems.

^^^^^^^^^^After the head was modified, testing made manifest Miriam's last bug:
.nf
.li 1
.in .5i
Bob:^^^^Let's see.  What have we done now.  You just typed "end" right after
^^^^^^^^we got the hair in....O.K.  So you cleared the screen.  Now what's going
^^^^^^^^to happen here ?
Miriam:^Oooops.
Bob:^^^^What are you typing in, PERSON ?  (Rises to camera)
Miriam:^Then let's see what he does.
Bob:^^^^There's the ears....Here comes the hair....What are we getting ?...
^^^^^^^^(Bug manifestation, see figure 1) Hey !  Wait a minute.
Miriam:^DUMMY ! (Big smile and laugh)
Bob:^^^^What's the problem ?...That doesn't look right.
Miriam:^(Speech too fast and excited to be comprehensible.)
^^^^^^^^The turtle [.......] and we didn't get him down to where he should be
^^^^^^^^to make the neck.
Bob:^^^^(Asking for clarification) What happened ?  We didn't do what, sweety ?
Miriam:^Get him down to the neck.
Bob:^^^^Oh.  Gee.
Miriam:^I guess he's flying (laughing to herself).
Bob:^^^^I don't think so. I think that's a bone fide bug, Miriam.

.fi b
.li 2
.in
It is the same old interface bug, but great fun in a new guise.  But beyond that, and what I find most striking here, oif all debugging incidents, is the joint appearance of two views of the problem.  First, Miriam describes the bug as an omission of ours, a debugging response she has achieved in the Logo debugging sessions.  Still present but now secondary and presented as a joke is the kind of excuse that formerly comprised Miriam's primary response to an uncomprehended problem.  I consider this as prima facie evidence for the reality of the competetion between active mental structures.  It marks just the kind of change in balance of competetion that differential development of competing active structures should be expected to result in.

Using the LOGO computer language, the children directed "the Turtle", a mechanical robot, to move about on the floor by specifying commands to move forward or back and turn right or left.  In a number of situations outside the laboratory, the children "imitated" the turtle's functions and the command language features.
