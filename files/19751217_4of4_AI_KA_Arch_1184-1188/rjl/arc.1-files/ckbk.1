     1/2 TSP sugar
          sour cream
          Place the meats, water and salt in a large (about 5 quart) Dutch oven and bring
     to a boil.  Then add the bay leaves and cracked pepper; cover and simmer for 2
     hours, stirring occasionally.  Add the onion, beets, carrot, celery, potatoes, tomatoes,
     dill weed and garlic; cook and hour more, stirring occassionally.  Add the cabbage and
     kidney beans; cook for another 30 minutes.  Remove the meats from the pot and shred it,
     discarding fat and bone.  return meat to pot.  Blend the water and flour together and add
     a little of the hot soup; stir this mixture into the pot and cook 5 more minutes.  Add
     the lemon juice and sugar and correct seasoning-if necessary.  Serve piping hot with sour
     cream.  (as this soup's flavour improves with age, you may want to save it for some later
     repast.)

          MULLIGAN
     1 (3/4-1 lb) slice ham, diced
     2 diced potatoes
     2 diced onions
     1 large can corn
     1 quart can tomatoes
          Cook the ham in water to cover til tender.  Add potatoes and onions, and cook 1
      hour.  Add the corn and the tomatoes.  Heat to a boil and serve.


          PUREE MONGOLE

     garlic, ginger and coriander.  Mix well.  Heat the oil and add the red pepper, mustard
     seed, cumin, curry powder.  Fry til the mustard seeds burst.  Add the turmeric, salt and
     lentils and bring to a boil.  Remove from heat and serve.  This is a thickish soup and
     is better eaten in rather small quantities--like as a stewed vegetable.
     COLD SOUPS

          Heat oven to 450 and warm bacon and (separately), spinach combined with cheese
     while bringing the salted water to a boil and poaching the eggs to the
     desired consistency (6 minutes produces a nice vulcanized egg).  Arrange the eggs on top
     of the bacon and top with the spinach-cheese mixture.  Mange!

          EGGSPERIMENT #2  (1)
     2 slabs canadian bacon
     2 tbsp butter
     2 eggs
     garted old parmesan cheese
     mozarella cheese (optional)
     pepper
          brown bacon on each side in small oven-proof dish.  break two eggs on top
of it, cover with layers of cheese (adding mozarella if you find the old parmesan too salty),
     sprinkle with black pepper and place under preheated broiler til the cheese is melted
     and the eggs are cooked to taste.

          KHAJINA   (1)
     1 tbsp butter

     5 eggs
     salt and pepper to taste
          In skillet over medium heat, saute corn and onion in drippings til a light
     crust forms on the corn; stirring well as cooking.  Beat the eggs with salt and
     pepper and pour over the corn, stirring often as they set.

     (filler) In baking, 1 egg equals 1/4 cup milk, 1 TBSP cornstarch and 1 TSP baking
     powder.

     TIPS ON SOUFFLES:
     Use a straight-sided, flat-bottomed dish
     To measure capacity, fill to the indentation forming the rim with water and measure.
     Use a rotary hand beater on the eggs
     Use a wooden spoon or spatula
     The sauce or custard base should be perfectly smooth
     If you sprinkle salt on the egg whites ere beating them, it'll shorten the beating time.
     If you add some cream of tartar to the whites during the beating process (at the foamy
     stage), it'll tend to increase the volume and stability of them
     After the souffle has been poured into a prepared dish, trace a 1 inch deep circle
     About 1 inch from the edge of the dish.
     Serve with a fork, not a spoon
     CHAPTER SIX

CHEESE
     INTRODUCTION TO CHEESES

(Serve all cheeses at room temperature for best flavour and texture.)

ALLGAUER EMMENTALER-see ALLGAUER BERGKASE

ALLGAUER BERGKASE (also known as ALLGAUER RUNDKASE and ALLGAUER EMMENTALER) is Germany's
  very popular version of Swiss EMMENTHAL.

ALLGAUER RAHMKASE is a German cheese resembling a splendid mild LIMBURGER.  RAHMKASE
  is sometimes flavoured with caraway seeds.

APPENZELL (or APPENZELLER) is a Swiss cheese, delicately flavoured and yet, especially
  aged, stronger than other in its group.  Both its small-holed interior and wrinkled exterior
  are golden.  In its youth, this cheese is steeped in spiced cider or wine for four or
  five days; though this process is not blatantly evident to the consumer.

BARBEREY is a soft French cheese resembling CAMEMBERT.

BEAUFORT (also known as GRUYERE DE BEAUFORT) is a French cheese, generally the same as
  SWISS GRUYERE, but richer and butterier.

BEL PAESE, meaning 'beautiful country', is an Italian cheese made from usually-pasteurized
  whole milk.  It's a grey-brown, circular cake with a semi-soft, fast-ripening interior. 
  The cheese combines a sweet, delicate flavour and a soft, rubbery texture.  BEL
  PAESE is primarily for eating: it can be a dessert with fruit or a wine...such
  as a SPATLESE of the RHEINGAU, a VOURNAY or a SOAVE.  The United States has a very
  close copy of BEL PAESE which is made in Wisconsin.

BLEU  D'AUVERGNE is a French copy of ROQUEFORT, made with cow's milk and with a butter-fat
  content of 45 percent.  Though this cheese sharpens as it matures, it remains less
  tangy than a ROQUEFORT.  Some appreciate BLEU D'AUVERGNE served with a SECIAL
  MADEIRA.

BLEU DE LAQUEILLE (also known as PUY-DE-DOME) is another French cheese resembling
  ROQUEFORT to some degree.  It has a semi-soft, crumbly, blue-white interior veined with a 
  darker blue.  This cheese is faster-maturing than a ROQUEFORT and its piquant flavour
  increases with age.

BLUE CHESHIRE is an English cheese, at its youth the same as other CHESHIRES.  The
  difference is the natural or artificial addition of penicillium glaucum, which produces
  the characteristic blue veining.  BLUE CHESHIRE is a very good, very expensive cheese
  which is, unfortunately, not exported to the United States.

BLUEFORD (and EREMITE) are Canadian blue cheeses, both made with cow's milk.

BLUE VINNEY (also known as DORSET BLUE and BLUE VEINY) is a skim-milk blue cheese made
  in England.  Rather than having capricous veining, it has a solid blue stripe down the
  center.  BLUE VINNEY is a strong, dry, crumbly cheese that rapidly becomes grainy and even
  harder than it was originally.  This cheese is not exported.

BONDON is a small, unripened, whole-milk French cheese of the NEUFCHATEL type.

BOURSAULT is a soft-ripened, delicately flavoured French cheese which is unusually smooth
  and rich.  It is richer and tangier than relative BOURSIN, and has a more definite odor.
  plain, the cheese is basically a dessert cheese, at its best with berries
  nuts and white wine...also fine on crackers.  It is also available  avec poivre.

BOURSIN, once a rival to BOURSAULT, has now been incorporated into the same company.  BOURSIN-AIL
  ET FINES HERBES has the colour, texture and flavour of whipped, salted butter, to which
  garlic and herbs have been added.  A fine cheese!

BRICK is an American whole-milk cheese usually categorized as a CHEDDAR type.  Physically, it 
  has a yellowish-brown exterior-which should be discarded,and a white to creamy yellow interior
  which is studded with small holes.  This cheese is midway between CHEDDAR AND LIMBURGER:
  it's softer than the former and firmer, more elastic than the latter.  Its flavour is mild
  and sweet when young, more pungent and pronounced when older.  It's good served on
  pumpernickel or rye bread (perhaps with some mild onion), accompanied by beer or ale.

BRIE, the exquisite French cheese with a 44 (plus) percent fat content, has been consistently
  referred to as 'the queen of cheeses.'  It has a brown edible crust and a creamy yellow
  interior with a texture comparable to heavy honey.  BRIE has a delicate bouquet and a
  flavour varying from mild to pungent, depending on age.  BRIE is best bought between December and
  March but one must still excercise great care in getting one of just the proper maturity.
  Serve this cheese with any of the following:  fresh or dried fruit, nuts, a full-bodied
  Bordeaux or Burgundy, cider, Remy-Martin cognac, calvados or a tawny port.

CACCIOCAVALLO is a whole milk Italian cheese with a slightly salty, smoky flavour somewhat like
  a cross between a GRUYERE and a CHEDDAR.  It's characterized by a light brown paraffined spindly
  shape and a yellowish-white interior.  This cheese is rather hard and dry (it keeps and
  travels well) and is both eaten and grated.

CAERPHILLY, a skim or semi-skim milk cheese, originated in Wales but is now made exclusively in
  England.  It is a white, unaged (being ready to sell locally in 5-10 days or to be exported
  in 2 or 3 weeks) cheese that tastes distictly of country buttermilk.  CAERPHILLY is
  somewhat moist, rather crumbly and--it must be said-- doesn't keep very well.  It is,
  however, easily digested and good eaten with cracked pepper and beer or ale to drink.
  (Others like to simply stir CAERPHILLY over low heat with an equal amount of beaten egg
  and a pinch of mustard to make a quick rarebit-type dish.)  This cheese is best bought
  in the Summer months.

CAMEMBERT, a rich whole-milk cheese from France, is at its best when purchased between January 
  and April.  It has a thin, grey-white edible crust, which has been sprayed with penicillium
  candidium (a gift from the now-rival BONDON cheese).  Its soft, creamy, yellowish interior
  has a mild, yet full, flavour and is good plain or with crackers, fruits, a full-bodied Burgundy
  or Bordeaux, Champagne, Cognac, Armagnac or a tawny port.

CANTAL, OR FOURME DE CANTAL, has been known in France since Roman times.  It is that country's
  nearest cheese to CHEDDAR, varying in flavour from distinctly cheddary to distinctly
  barn-yardy.  CANTAL is a firm cheese with a tough, callused rind and pale yellow innards.
  Try eating this cheese with apples or pears.

CARRE DE L'EST is a good copy of CAMEMBERT from the Alsace-Lorraine area of France.
  It's a 3+3/4 inch, 6 or 7 ounce square, as indicated by its name, with a mouldy, chestnut-
  coloured crust.  CARRE DE LEST's fat content is 40 (plus) percent.

CHANTELLE is a red-coated American (Illinois) cheese cured in the same manner as BEL PAESE.
  This ripened, semi-hard variety has an interior varying in cream to light orange.  Its flavour
  is mild to pronounced, depending on the particular CHANTELLE's age.

(American) CHEDDAR is aged from 2 months to 2 years, its sharpness increasing with age.
  It is a firm, sometimes crumbly cheese, made from pasteurized whole milk and having
  a colour varying from cream to a deep orange.  CHEDDAR is used both in cooking and eating:
  beer or ale are good companions, and an aged sharp CHEDDAR also goes well with Amontillado.

(Canadian) CHEDDAR is made with unpasteurized whole milk- otherwise like the American version.
  It's robust flavour compares favourably to any manufactured in the nited States and the
  5 pound Canadian CHEDDAR wheels are the closest you can get to the superlative English
  farmhouse CHEDDAR.  Serve as you would American CHEDDAR.

(Great Britain) CHEDDAR is drier and milder than the American variety and also mellower 
 than CHESHIRE.  The rarer CHEDDAR, made in English farm-houses is better than any factory-
  made and, alas, the United States and Canada only produce the latter sort.  Unfortunately, U.S.
  law also prohibits English CHEDDAR from being imported.
  (see serving suggestions under American CHEDDAR)

CHESHIRE CHEESE, called "CHESTER" on the continent, has been known in Cheshire County, England
  since the twelfth century.  Its colour varies from cream (WHITE CHESHIRE) to a warm gold
  (RED CHESHIRE), made that colour by the addition of annatto dye.  CHESHIRE CHEESE has
  a firm, fairly crumbly texture and is used both for cooking and eating (try it with a robust 
  Claret or beer).  Its rich mellow tang, which increases with age, is partly due to the natural
  saltiness of the milk produced in Cheshire pastures.  For this reason, CHESHIRE is not as 
  widely copied as CHEDDAR, STILTON OR CAERPHILLY.  As a result, CHESHIRE is a very reliable
  cheese and a well-aged CHESHIRE is a too-rare delicacy.

COLBY CHEESE is a mild domestic cheese made from either raw or pasteurized whole milk.
  Coloured a deep yellow, it is softer and moister than CHEDDAR ...and doesn't keep as well.
  COLBY can, however, be marketed in 3 or 4 weeks instead of the months required by CHEDDAR.
  Use this cheese for both eating and cooking.

COMTE is a French version of GRUYERE; it is made and shaped the same way.  COMTE keeps
  well, melts well, and has fewer and smaller holes than EMMENTHAL.

COON is a U.S. whole milk cheese, which is cured at a higher temperature and humidity than
  its cousin--CHEDDAR.  Its surface is a deep chocolate brown and its texture is rather crumbly.
  The taste is extremely sharp and tangy.  If you're in the market for a good CHEDDAR and
  aren't headed for a cheese specialty store, the one year old, black-wrapped COON sticks
  are a good bet.  Use this cheese for eating and cooking.

CORNHUSKER, or HUSKER, is much like COLBY and CHEDDAR though it's softer, moister and takes
  less time to make than either.  It's made only at the Nebraskan State University's Agricultural
  Experiment Station and CORNHUSKER was named after that college's football team.

COTTAGE CHEESE is a bright white, soft, curdy variety made from skim milk coagulated by a
  pure lactic acid bacteria culture.  After this process, cream, salt, and optional flavorings
  (such as chives, pineapple or finely chopped vegetables) are added.  This faintly acid cheese
  is used both in eating and  cooking; Americans consume an average 4.5 pounds per year.

CREMA DANIA was invented by a Dane in 1957.  It has the texture of BRIE at its best and is 
  more reliable cheese than either BRIE or CAMEMBERT.  For the best flavour, this cheese 
  should be left out for a considerable amount of time ere consumpton.

DANBLU of Denmark (erstwhile called Danish Roquefort) is actually a cow's milk substitute
  for GORGONZOLA.  It's a strongly flavoured, salty, blue cheese with a buttery consistency (50
  -plus percent fat content).  DANBLU is richer, 'fruitier,' than other blue cheeses and
  definitely superior to domerstic blues.  Try some with a red delicious apple sometime.

DANBO, also of Denmark, is similar in flavour to Samsoe.

DANISH BRIE is an excellent creamy cheese with very little resemblance to French BRIE.  This
  cheese has a distinctive flavour which varies from mild to pronounced; its crust is
  edible.

DANISH CAMEMBERT is an excellent copy of the French, staying runny longer and
  having a mushroom-like flavour.  It's crust, covered with a grey-white mold, is entirely edible.

DANISH EDAM-see MOLBO.

DANISH EMMENTHAL is another good copy-it's a firm cheese with many large holes and the
  slightly sweet nut-like flavour associated with EMMENTHAL.

DANISH STEPPE CHEESE-see DANBO

DEMI-SEL is a small (about 4 ounce) fresh French cream cheese with a salt content of 2 percent
  and a fat content of 40 percent.  This cheese is particularly good in NORMANDY.

EDAM is the partly skim milk Dutch cheese characterized by its red-waxed surface (a face shown 
  only for export).  Its innards are yellow and firmer than that of a gouda.  Young EDAM
  are slightly salty, while the older, a really fine cheese, has a more pronounced flavour.
  Try eating EDAM with some honeydew melon.

ELBO is a Danish cheese with a milder flavour than cousin SAMSOE.

EMMENTHAL (Swiss) is made from the highest quality whole milk at Emme Valley in Berne.  
  This cheese has a greyish-brown exterior and a slightly glossy, light yellow interior,
  scattered with holes. (A proprionic acid-former is added in the early stages and the bacteria
  continue working throughout the aging process.  As a result, natural gas is formed and
  it collects in pockets from which there is no escape.  The cheeses are turned two or more
  times a week to keep these holes relatively regular.)  EMMENTHAL has an elastic, chewy
  texture and a mild nutty flavour often likened to hazelnuts or walnuts.  It's used for 
  cooking, grating and eating:  in sandwiches, salads and fondus.

EMMENTHAL (Danish) is a good copy of the original Swiss.

ESROM, once called the "Danish Port Salut," is decidely stronger and keeps better
  than that namesake.  Some think this fine cheese preferable to PORT SALUT because of its
  definite flavour, but it can be too strong.  Texturewise, it's soft, cream-coloured and prickled
  with small holes.

FETTA (FETA) is a Greek cheese made from either ewes' or goats' milk, and generally
  pasteurized for export.  It is white, soft and salty, being pickled in a brine of milk,
  salt and water.  This brine should be drained from the cheese and it should then be 
  stored in a covered container of skim milk.


FONTINA, one of the fullest Italian cheeses, is a great cheese of its kind--the best being
  the original FONTINA D'AOSTA.  It is generally made with whole goats' milk, while that 
  which is imported may be made from ewes' milk instead.  FONTINA, which dates back to the
  11th century, is made by the same method that the Swiss use to GRUYERE and it combines
  the tang of that cheese with the delicate, nutty flavour of a good EMMENTHAL...with a hint
  of PORT SALUT thrown in for good measure.  Physically, FONTINA has a light brown oiled
  crust-like a GRUYERE (beware of those with a red rind), and a warm ivory coloured body,
  punctuated by a few small holes.  Its texture is firm and satiny and it makes a superb melting
  cheese.  FONTINA is also considered to be a good dessert cheese; try serving it with an
  Italian Soave.

FOURME DE CANTAL--see CANTAL

FYNBO was named after a very large island in the middle of Denmark.  This cheese, with its mild 
  flavour, firm texture and regular holes, has been called the Danish GOUDA by some.

GAMMELOST is a Norwegian blue cheese made from skimmed sour milk.  It has a golden-brown exterior,
  a blue-veined interior and varies from being semi-soft to hard.  GAMMELOST is an eating
  cheese.

GAUTRIAS is a French cheese resembling PORT SALUT.

GJETOST, a cow and goat milk whey cheese, is one of the national cheeses of Norway, one that
  some people undoubtedly wish they had never encountered.  This golden-brown, semi-soft
  to hard cheese tastes unlike other goat cheese and, indeed, unlike many other cheeses
  in that it is sweet.  This characteristic is accomplished through the addition of caramelized
  lactose or a little brown sugar.  GJETOST, the grainy texture, controversial (to foreigners)
  cheese of Norway, is an eating cheese that keeps rather well.
GLOUCESTER (double) is an English cheese which, centuries ago, was being made from the Gloucester
  breed of cattle.  It is a solid cheese, gold in colour--due to annatto dye, with a moist
  silky texture.  Gloucester is somewhere between a CHEDDAR and a CHESHIRE in taste (and
  texture), being full-flavoured and gently pungent, yet not sharp.  Though this cheese is 
  regaining its popularity, it's difficult to find a really good one.  When you do, consume
  it with beer or ale.

GORGONZOLA is an Italian cheese made from whole cow's milk.  It has a cylindrically-shaped,
  clay-coloured surface and a white body, veined in pale green.  GORGONZOLA's texture is
  semi-soft and crumbly; its taste is both stronger and creamier than that of other blues. 
  This excellent cheese may be eaten with crackers, fruits, and salads, among other
  things.  If you find it too strong, GORGONZOLA may be mixed with some sweet butter ere
  consuming.

GOUDA, a Dutch cow's milk cheese, is similar to EDAM.  It ranges from semi-soft to
  hard (since it contains more fat than EDAM, it's generally softer) and has a straw-yellow
  interior, speckled with a few even holes.  A GOUDA's taste is strong and mellow.  Old
  goudas, relatively uncommon in the U.S., are a real find.  They are recognizable
  by their smooth rounded edges; younger ones have sharp edges where the sides meet top and
  bottom.  GOUDA is primarily an eating cheese.

GRUYERE is a whole cows' milk cheese which has been made in Switzerland for over 200 years.  It
  has a grey-brown wrinkled skin, kept moist with brine, and a body ranging in colour from creamy
  to light yellow.  One can make various comparisons between this cheese and EMMENTHAL:  tastewise
  GRUYERE is slightly sharper than, more sophisticated than EMMENTHAL; its holes are smaller
  and fewer than EMMENTHAL's; GRUYERE is saltier than EMMENTHAL and ripens longer, at a lower
  temperature; it's also creamier than EMMENTHAL, having a higher fat content of 48 percent.
  GRUYERE is used both for eating and cooking.  Try this cheese with crackers or fruit, Harvey's
  Bristol Cream, a fine haute sauterne or a cool white mountain wine.

GRUYERE (French) is a very good copy of the Swiss Gruyere.

GUSSING, from Austria, is similar to BRICK CHEESE.

HAND CHEESE is a small, conical American cheese, made from a combination of sour and skim milk--
  perhaps with the additon of caraway.  It has a dark grey rind and a gelatinous-looking interior.
  Originally shaped by hand (and, thus, its name), this cheese is soft, pungent and at times
  so strong that those who revel in LIMBURGER wince.  For this reason, hand cheese is
  definitely an acquired taste.

HAVARTI was once called "Danish Tilsit."  This irregularly holed cheese is mild and rather
  bland when young but, aged, it is full-flavoured and leaves a piquant aftertaste.

HERKIMER COUNTY is an unusual United States' CHEDDAR in that it is white, avec no added coloration.
  textured crumbly, it has a smooth, sharp, full flavour.

HERRGARD is a good Swiss copy of EMMENTHAL.  There are actually two varieties:  HERRGARD ELITE,
  a full cream cheese, is similar to EMMENTHAL in flavour and has less holes; regular HERRGARD
  actually leans toward a GOUDA in taste.

HERVE, a Belgian cheese, is like a strong soft LIMBURGER.  It may have herbs or olives
   added to it.

JACK-see MONTEREY

KARTANO is a Finnish Gouda

KASSERI is a hard Grecian sheep's milk cheese.  In this case, a copy from the United States
  is distinctly preferable to the original.  It has a faintly winy flavour 
  somewhere between CHEDDAR and PARMESAN.
KING CHRISTIAN IX is a mild Danish cheese in the SAMSOE class.  When young, this rich, soft cheese 
  with caraway seeds has a very good flavour; this increases unfavourably as the cheese ages.

LACASHIRE is a white English cheese rarely found outside Lancashire where it's made.  Both
  stronger and crumblier than cousins CHEDDAR and CHESHIRE, LANCASHIRE's wonderful flavour
  increases with age.  This cheese melts beautifully to a custardy consistency, and is splendid
  on crackers, in soups, etc. Unfortunately, LANCASHIRE keeps rather poorly.

LEICESTER is one of the mildest English cheeses which becomes rich, creamy and tangy in one's
  mouth.  This warm russet coloured cheese (annatto again) of growing popularity is rather loose
  and crumbly in texture.  It has a higher moisture content than CHEDDAR and doesn't keep as well.
  LEICESTER is excellent for cooking--used in rarebits, sauces and sandwiches--and eating with
  fruit or salad.

LIEDERKRANZ is an American whole milk copy of LIMBURGER--though that was not it's original
  intent.  This soft, moist cheese has an edible russet exterior and creamy yellow innards.
  While some people prefer LIEDERKRANZ in an uncured, not-yet-smelly state, others appreciate it 
  after it has developed the taste and aroma of a mild LIMBURGER.  In this state, LIEDERKRANZ is 
  best served on pumpernickel or sour rye bread--perhaps with the addition of some mild onion-
  with beer, ale, or a simple white wine to imbibe.

LIMBURGER, or LIMBOURG, is a semi-soft, whole milk Belgian cheese, also made extensively in Germany.
  Physically, it can be identified by a grey-brown exterior and creamy insides.  When fresh,
  LIMBURGER actually is quite odorless and tasteless; its full aromatic--to be polite--taste and 
  odor develop as it ages.  Like LIEDERKRANZ, LIMBURGER is best accompanied by pumpernickel
  or other dark bread, onions and beer.

LIPTAUER CHEESE originated in Liptow Province, North Hungary.  It's created by you, now:
  combine 4 ounces cream cheese, 4 ounces butter, 5 chopped anchovies, 1 ounce of capers,
  1.5 TSP paprika and 1 scant TSP dijon mustard.  Voila!  (This is, needless to say, not the
  only recipe.  Others includes or substitute ripe olives, pimiento, chives, garlic, hot
  peppers and/or onions.)

MARIBO is a Danish cheese studded with small holes and having a very mild flavour that
  lies between that of PORT SALUT and EMMENTHAL.

MASCARPONE (MASCAPONE, MASCHERPONE) is a fresh cream cheese found all over Italy but surfacing
  very rarely in the United States.  Generally, this butter-coloured cheese, with a taste like
  whipped cream, is found in 4-ounce muslin bags.  It's fine with fruits--especially berries,
  on bread or beaten up with sugar and brandy.

MINNESOTA BLUE was intended to be an American ROQUEFORT but, made from cows' milk, it matured 
  into something different.  While a good cheese, it is not a ROQUEFORT.

MOLBO is the Danish EDAM, both in looks and flavour.

MONTEREY JACK is a mild, cheddar-type American cheese named after 19th century dairy farmer,
  David Jacks.  This semi-hard, bland (for a CHEDDAR), cream-coloured cheese is usually
  cured 3 to 6 weeks instead of the months or years required by other CHEDDAR types.  MONTEREY
  JACK is used for eating, cooking (especially in Mexican foods), and grating.

MOZZARELLA is an Italian cheese usually made from cows' milk-- occassionally from buffalo milk.
  A light cream-coloured semi-soft, mild cheese, MOZZARELLA is at its best freshly made.  It's
  utilized in eating and cooking; this cheese's good melting quality causes it to be found
  in many Italian main dishes.

MUNSTER (MUENSTER), a whole-milk French cheese, is not too unlike PONT L'EVEQUE.  It has
  a yellow to tan surface and an interior ranging from white, when fresh, to a light yellow.
  MUNSTER is semi-soft, having a fat content of 45 percent.  Originally milder, the aged
  European variety can be very strong .  Occassionally, caraway or cumin may be added
  to it.

MYSOST is similar to GJETOST, its fellow Norwegian national cheese.  It is, however, made with cows'
  milk instead of goats' milk.

NEUFCHATEL of France is a white, soft, bland cream cheese type, made from slightly salted
  whole milk.  It has a lower fat content (20 percent minimum) and a higher protein content than
  CREAM CHEESE.  It is also smoother and easier spread than that cheese.

NOKKELOST is a Norwegian cheese with Dutch origins.  It's something like a gouda with added spices
  such as cloves, cumin or caraway, which give it an aroma and piquant flavour of its own.  The
  exported variety has a fat content of 30 to 40 percent.

OKA, a cow's milk cheese from Canada, comes to you courtesy of the Trappist Monks of Oka, Quebec.
  it has a russet exterior and a semi-soft, creamy-yellow interior.  OKA, an excellent cheese, has
  a robust flavour comparable to that of PORT SALUT.

PARMESAN is a familiar Italian cheese made of partially skimmed milk.  It has a lamp black-burnt
  umber coating to shut out the light which may turn the cheese rancid.  The PARMESAN is
  whitish, perhaps with a yellowish or greenish tinge to it, and very hard.  The young, mild cheese
  is for eating, like with melon; the matured, more flavourful PARMESAN is best for grating.
  I must interject, at this point, that pre-grated parmesan is a travesty of some
  sort; a parmesan's flavour is at its peak freshly grated ...also, one must harbour suspicions about
  the quality and national origion of this cheese when found in a pre-grated form.

PECORINO is the blanket name for all Italian cheeses made from ewe's milk.

PETIT-SUISSE is a grand, unripened cream cheese-- a description that hardly does it justice.  This
  soft, rich morsel--made from fresh whole milk and additional cream--is fine served with strawberries
  or raspberries and sugar.  It also goes nicely with fellow French cheese, ROQUEFORT.  Happily,
  PETIT SUISSE is occassionally available in the United States, under the name of DEMI-SUISSE.
  as it must be quick-frozen for traveling, there will probable be some separation--don't worry,
  drain and enjoy!

POIVRE D'ANE, made in upper Provence (France) is molded by hand (moulded by hand??)
  and packed in savory and rosemary.

PONT L'EVEQUE, meaning bishop's bridge, is another soft-ripened French cheese made either
  from rich whole or lightly skimmed milk.  Outwardly, the cheese is a reddish-gold square, cross
  hatched from lying on a straw mat; its innards are pale yellow with tiny holes.  PONT L'EVEQUE's
  soft, sharp flavour--which increases with age--is due to the fungus growth, monilia candida.  This
  is a very fine eating cheese, perhaps accompanied by fruit, cider or a wine such
  as tawny port, a full-bodied Burgundy or Bordeaux, Calvados or applejack.

PORT SALUT or PORT DU SALUT, one of the best French cheeses when at the proper maturity, is made
  by Trappist Monks.  This cheese, made from whole or partially skimmed milk, has a russet
  rind and a firm, creamy interior.  With an aroma like LIMBURGER, PORT SALUT's flavour varies 
  from very mild when young (as usually seen in the U.S.) to robust when older; it's sometimes like
  a cross between CAMEMBERT and BEL PAESE.  Primarily an eating cheese, perhaps with some Medoc, 
  this is a pretty dependable cheese which keeps a long time.

PROVOLONE is the hard, whole-milk Italian cheese which is gradually replacing the leaner CACCIOCAVALLO
  as Italian table cheese.  It has a thin satiny, yellow crust, a creamy-white interior and a 
  smoky flavour.  PROVOLONE is a good cooking and eating cheese, perhaps nibbled with some
  fruit for dessert.

QUESO MANTECOSO ('CHANCO'), Chile's best cheese, is a reasonable copy of PORT SALUT.

RACLETTE- see VALAIS RACLETTE

REBLOCHON, a semi-soft French cows'-milk copy of PORT SALUT somewhat resembles a CAMEMBERT.  Its
  exterior varies from orange to chestnut; its insides are pale and creamy.  A truly excellent cheese
  at its prime, REBLOCHON is apt to be bitter when old.

RICOTTA--The Italian version of RICOTTA is wet, white and soft like our COTTAGE CHEESE but, being
  made from whey, it's smoother with no solid curds.  The American version is often made with
  whole milk and is, thus, more curdy than its Italian relative.  RICOTTA is used for eating and
  cooking; in dishes like lasagna and manicotti.

ROMADUR (ROMADURKASE) is a German cheese made from whole or partially skimmed cows' milk.  It's
  soft and similar to a mild LIMBURGER in aroma, though smaller and less salty.  Eat ROMADUR
  like you would LIMBURGER.

ROQUEFORT CHEESE must be made from ewes' milk in the Roquefort District of Causses, France.  It's
  ancient:  Pliny praised it in the first century A.D.   ROQUEFORT has a yellowish-brown rind and
  a white, blue-green veined interior.  This veining is caused by penicillium roqueforti, made
  from rye bread crumbs.  The cheese has a sharp, almost tart, salty flavour-- since it's salted
  for export, ROQUEFORT may end up too salty, in which case you can combine it with some sweet
  butter.  Sharing the title "king of cheese" with fellow-blue, STILTON, ROQUEFORT is regularly
  superb when purchased in France.  Used both for cooking and eating, try it with fruit, crackers,
  nuts, salads, a full-bodied Burgundy or Claret.

SAGE or VERMONT CHEESE, from the United States, is basically a young, mild (white)
  CHEDDAR to which sage extract or real sage has been added.  This green-mottled cooking/grating
  cheese is good if you're 'into' sage.

SAMSOE is a buttery Danish version of the Swiss EMMENTHAL.  A semi-hard, holed, whole-milk
  cheese with nut-like flavour, SAMSOE is used both for eating and cooking.

SAPSAGO, a very hard, non-fat cheese, originates from Switzerland.  Its characteristic light green
  colour and pungent flavour are caused by the addition of alpine clover.  Conical Sapsago is
  used both for eating and grating.

SBRINZ, from Switzerland, bears a slight resemblance in flavour to a medium-sharp GRUYERE.  It 
  has a grey-green surface and a granular white interior.  A very hard cheese, taking three
  years to cure, SBRINZ is one of the oldest European hard cheeses.

STEPPE-see DANBO

STILTON, a great English blue cheese, shares the title 'king of cheeses' with ROQUEFORT.  This
  cheese has a wrinkled surface and a cream-coloured, blue-veined interior.  Its sharp tantalizing
  flavour and aroma is a little subtler than that of other blues.  Traditionally served with
  port, nuts and raisins, STILTON is also eaten with other fruits and/or madeira, cream sherry or
  cognac.

SWISS-see EMMENTHAL


TILSITER (TILSIT) is a whole or skim milk German cheese of the PORT SALUT type, though sharper 
  than the latter and sometimes compared with a mild LIMBURGER.  It's yellowish, medium-firm and
  full of tiny holes ...usually used for eating.

VACHERIN DES BEAUGES, a very rare, whole-milk French cheese is well worth mentioning.  Despite
  its firm hard rind, this aromatic cheese's interior is so runny that it must be eaten with a
  spoon.  Accompany it, perhaps, with a fruit.

VALAIS RACLETTE of Switzerland is named after the scraped melted cheese dish is which it's
  frequently used.  (Let me interject that when Heidi's grandfather prepared this dish, I
  was struck by its simplicity and drooling to try it.)  This cheese--which cures for three
  months--is mild and tangy in taste, rich and creamy--50-plus percent butterfat--in texture.

VERMONT SAGE--see SAGE

WENSLEYDALE, of England, is alot like a subtle, elusive CAERPHILLY in its youth; as it
  ages, it becomes more like a medium-hard CHEDDAR.  Origionally a parchment colour, matured it
  becomes blue-veined.  Some consider this particular WENSLEYDALE to be better than STILTON,
  to which it's very similar.  For eating and cooking, in Yorkshire, this cheese is traditionally
  served with tart apple pie.  It is also the cheese used in Dale Pudding (i'm looking), an
  old Yorkshire recipe, And Wensleydale Dip (popular in Great Britain), which combines 4 ounces
  cheese, 4 chopped walnuts, 4 TBSP warm cream, un peu onion juice, some chopped watercress,
  a pinch of cayenne and salt-if necessary.

WESTPHALIA SAUERMILCH, a German cheese, is kneaded by hand with butter, egg yolks, pepper and
  caraway seeds.  In a ripe state, it makes a good spread.

FISH AND SHELLFISH
     FISH          

          SALMON MOUSSE (6)
     1 (1 LB) can salmon
     2 egg whites
     1 TBSP lemon juice
     1+1/2 cups heavy cream
     1 TSP salt
     1/8 TSP freshly ground black pepper
     fine dry bread crumbs
     HOLLANDAISE SAUCE (See VEGETABLE SAUCES)
          Flake salmon, remove bones and drain in colander for at least 30 minutes.  Heat
     oven to 325.  Place 1/2 the salmon, egg whites and lemon juice in blender.  When
     blended, add remaining salmon, cream, salt and pepper and mix well.  Grease a 1-qt mold
     (a fish shaped one is ideal) and sprinkle with crumbs to coat the inside completely.
     Pour the salmon mixture into the mold and set into a baking pan containing 1 inch of
     boiling water.  Bake 1+1/2 hours or til the mousse is firm to the touch.  Remove
     mold from pan and let stand for 5 minutes.  Unmold carefully:  slide a sharp knife around
     edges of mold, put warm plate face down on top of it, and quickly invert mold and plate
     together.  Serve with hollandaise sauce.

          SAMBAL GORENG UDANG  (2)
     2 TSP sambal oelek
     1 large onion, coarsely chopped
     2 large cloves of garlic, pressed
     3/4 TSP laos powder

     Heat the oil in a frying pan or wok; add blended mixture and fry for a few minutes,
     stirring occassionally, to bring out the flavour and aroma of the spices.
     Add the shrimp; stir.  Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.  Cook, stirring 
     occassionally, til the shrimp become pink and look done.  serve.  (you may thicken this
     sauce with cornstarch, if desired.)


          SESAME FISH FILLETS (4)
     2 LBS fish fillets
     3 cloves garlic, minced
     1 TSP salt
     6 TBSP melted butter
     3 TBSP scotch or brandy
     3 TBSP lemon juice
     s TBSP soy sauce
     2 TSP minced fresh ginger
     1+1/2 cups sesame seeds

     (filler)  Cold decreases the already-delicate flavour of shrimp and other crustaceans.
     Buy lobster off cracked ice.  Lobsters kept in pools are apt to contain 2 or 3 expensive ounces
     of water.
          Don't eat dead shellfish:  if a clam shell is not tightly closed and doesn't
     snap shut when tapped, the clam is dead; mussels are dead if running cold water
     over the shell for 1 or 2 minutes doesn't open it.CHAPTER EIGHT

      (filler)  Notes On The Serving Of Curries
     1. Authentic curry accompaniments are boorthas, foogaths and raitas.
     2. Inauthentic accompaniments are peanuts, coconut, onions, raisins, hard-boiled eggs
      and mango chutney...and, speaking of mango chutney, note that Major Grey Chutney
       is not authentic Indian chutney.
     3. The two correct beverages to drink with a curry are beer and tea.  If you must drink
       wine, choose chablis, a dry sauterne, reisling or pinot chardonnay.
     4. In India, curries are served on banana leaves or little brass trays and are
       eaten avec fingers.

     repeat layers once more.  Close top of steak and broil on each side to desired degree of

     Bake on a large well greased and pammed cookie sheet (about 10+1/2 x 15, with a rim,
     and for your sake, hopefully teflon) for 30 or more minutes or til the usual
     finger-poking test show that they're done.  Immediately cut into bars and remove from
     pan.


     DROP COOKIES

          QUICK COCONUT MACAROONS (1 dozen)

     MACERATED STRAWBERRIES:  being thoroughly sick of the gelatin/cornstarch glop
normally found on cheesecake, I've started simply slicing about 3 pints of strawberries,
adding sugar and cognac or grand marnier to taste and letting them chill and steep a day ere using.

          DELICE AU CHOCOLAT
     (I don't quite know how to categorize this dessert.  It's not really a cake, and thus
     doesn't belong in the cake category...but if you never found a satisfactory chocolate cake,
     I'd steer you in this direction.)
     2+2/3 cups semisweet chocolate chips
     5 eggs, separated
     1 TBSP brandy
     1 TBSP granulated sugar
     2 TBSP flour
     1/4 TSP cinnamon
     1/4 TSP salt
     1 stick plus 2 TBSP butter, softened
     sifted confectioner's sugar
          Place the chocolate chips in the top of a double boiler over boiling water.  Cover
     and set over very low heat.  From heat.  Let stand 10 minutes, then stir til melted
     and smooth.  Beat the egg yolks til thick.  Beat in the brandy, sugar, flour, cin-
     namon and butter.  Add the chocolate and mix gently til smooth.  Beat the egg whites
     and salt til stiff but not dry and fold thoroughly into the chocolate mixture.  Turn
     into an 8 inch round pan (at least 2 inches deep, and avec a greased brown paper
     circle in the bottom of it and buttered or pammed sides).  Bake 20 to 25 minutes at
     400 or til center's firm (ie not liquid) when touched lightly.  (It won't look done,
     but as it cools, it'll become firm with a characteristic depression in the center.)
     Cool thoroughly in pan on wire rack.   Then turn out of pan and remove the paper.
     Sprinkle top with confectioner's sugar and serve in wedges.

FRUIT
     APPLES--from the Middle English "appel" or "eppel" from the Latin "abella".  Of  the 
     pyrus malus, are native to Eastern Europe and Western Asia and have been
     grown for over 3000 years.  The apple contains approximately 75 calories and has
     practically no nutritional value.

          APPLE CRISP
     2 cups sliced tart apples
     1/2 TSP cinnamon
     1/2 cup water
     1/2 cup butter or margarine
     3/4 cup flour
     1/4 TSP salt
     1/2 cup sugar
     another 6 TBSP sugar
          Place apples somewhat evenly in a greased baking dish.  Add a mixture of
     cinnamon, water, and the 1/2 cup sugar.  Mix the butter, flour, salt and remaining
     sugar til the mixture's crumbly.  Sprinkle over the apples.  Bake 1 hour in a
     moderate oven.


     APRICOTS--from the French "abricot", Greek "praikokion", Latin "praecoquum"-prunus 
     armeniaca, are native to Asia where they have been cultivated
     for at least 4000 years.   medium fresh apricot contains about 18 calories, 1 dried
     apricot half contains approximately thirteen.

          COLD APRICOT-ALMOND SOUFFLE (8)
     1+1/2 cups dried apricot halves
     1/3 cup sugar
     1/2 cup boiling water
     3 OZ package lemon gelatin
     3 egg whites
     1/8 TSP cream of tartar
     3/4 cup heavy cream
     1/2 TSP almond extract
     2 TBSP chopped, toasted almonds
          Place the apricots in a medium saucepan with 2 cups of cold water; bring to a
     boil.  Reduce heat; simmer, covered, 25 minutes or til tender.  Add the sugar and cook
     5 minutes, stirring occassionally.  Cool slightly.  Press the apricots and their
     liquid thru a sieve to make a puree (or blend in blender at high speed for 1 minute).
     Measure the puree, if necessary add water to make 2+1/2 cups.  Pour the boiling water over the 
     gelatin, stirring to dissolve.  Add this to the puree, mixing well.  Refrigerate, stirring
     occassionally 2 hours or til the consistency of unbeaten egg white.  Meanwhile, in large
     bowl of electric mixer, let the egg whites warm to room temperature.  Lightly grease
     the bottom and sides of a straight-edged 1+1/2 quart souffle dish, a mold or a bowl.
     Beat whites at high speed with the cream of tartar just til stiff peaks form.  With
     rubber scraper, using an under and over motion, gently fold whites into the apricot
     mixture til well combined.  With rotary beater, beat the cream and almond extract til 
     stiff.  Gently fold into the apricot mixture til well-combined.  Turn into the prepared
     dish and chill, covered, 8 hours or overnight.  Before serving, press the almonds
     evenly over the top.

     BANANAS--native to Asia.  Medium banana contains about 85 calories.
     BLACKBERRIES--from the Middle English "blakberye" from the as blaec berie
     BLUEBERRIES-vaccinium genus.  Peak season june-august.

          BLUEBERRY GRUNT   (4)
     Most recipes for blueberry grunt have the dough dropped as a dumpling into a pot of
     boiling blueberry sauce; I think this one, with the dough baked as a biscuit,
     is much preferable.
     1/3 cup sugar
     1/2 TSP cinnamon
     1/2 tsp nutmeg
     1 TSP grated lemon zest
     1/4 cup molasses
     3 TBSP lemon juice
          BISCUIT CRUST
     1 cup flour
     2 TSP baking powder
     1/4 tsp salt
     4 TBSP butter
     1 egg
     1/4 cup plus 2 TBSP evaporated milk
          Spread the blueberries evenly in a 9 inch pie plate.  Combine the 1/3 cup sugar, cinnamon,
nutmeg and zest, and spoon evenly over the berries.  Dribble on the mollasses and sprinkle
on the lemon juice.  Bake 7 minutes at 375, or til the berries begin to render juice.
Remove from oven and increase heat to 425.  Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, and
cut in the butter thoroughly.  Beat the eggs and milk together and stir into the flour mixture.
Drop the dough by spoonfuls somewhat evnly over the berries and spread together to cover them
completely.  Bake 20 minutes or til well browned.  Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
     This works very well with a cherry filling.

     CHERRIES--from the Middle English "chery" from the Latin "cerasus" (cherry tree) from
           the Greek "kerasos" (the tree)

     2 TBSP thawed orange juice concentrate
          Combine all ingredients and chill overnight.  Serve cold, garnished with sprigs
     of fresh mint

          (filler) A ripe pineapple should be aromatic and heavy for its size.  When
     thumped, you should hear a dull sound.  It should not have a soft dark area near its
     base:  it would then be ripe to the point of imminent decay.


     PLUMS and PRUNES--from the as plume from the Greek "prounon" meaning "prune plum"
