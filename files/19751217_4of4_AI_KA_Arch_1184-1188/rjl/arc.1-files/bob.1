1Good afternoon and welcome to our liturgy of thanksgiving.
My brother Bob, our parents, our grandmother and my wife Pat
all thank you for joining us in our celebration. We hope
that you'll sing out with us, under the leadership of Nick Covino,
whom you've just met. To follow along with the mass, you will
need only the yellow program which you recieved upon entering the
chruch.

0hold up program1

Bob asks that we all remain standing throughout the eucharistic
prayer. This is a sign that, even while we are praising the lord,
we are always ready to move, ready to answer his call.
Please notice that Bob has included the ECUMENICAL translation
of the Lord's prayer in the program. 0show them1
Please take note of that at the appropriate time. Finally, we ask
that you follow the directions of the ushers at communion time.
.br
Now kindly stand and greet our celebrant!

That they may all be given the fullness of God's light and
peace, let us pray to the Lord.

For everyone gathered here this afternoon, that God may show
to each of us the way of peace, of lasting joy, and of that
light that shines forth to save the world, let us pray to the
Lord.
.sp
For Paul our pope, Humberto our bishop, Pedro Arrupe
the superior general of the Society of Jesus, and Joseph Burke the
pastor of this church, that the Holy Spirt will continue to
lead them in joyful service of the people of God, let
us pray to the Lord.
.sp
If anyone wishes to share a petition with the community,
kindly stand up and speak up so that we can join you in
prayer.

0wait a bit1
.sp
FOr all those people around the world whose lives are not
in peace, those who suffer from war or famine or the oppression
of their neighbors, for all those who do not find cause to
sing with joy to the Lord, that we may in some way reach out to them and give
them cause for joy, let us pray to the Lord.
.sp
Let us conclude our prayer by showing that we are at peace with
one another. As we prepare to celebrate the Eucharist, we
offer to one another a sign of peace.

0don't do anything until end of the song
Bread and Wine, then stand up and say:1
For communion we ask that you follow the directions of the ushers.
To receive the bread, come to the center of the church.
To then share in the cup, go either to the left or to
the right, where Fathers Henning and McMillan will be standing.

0after communion, Bob and Nick do a little number, then
wait 20 seconds after Bob sits down:1
.sp
We hope that you will join the family for a reception
in the chruch hall immediately following this liturgy. For most
people, it will be easier to walk to the hall than to find
a parking place there. Just walk down Salem Street two blocks,
to he first street light, then turn right and continue for
two short blocks to the well marked old chruch building on
the left side of the street. Bob will be giving first blessings
at the reception on the first floor of the building, and refreshments
will be sereved on the second floor. You can decide for yourselves
which you need more after this long liturgy!
.sp
For those who live in the area, it may be of innterest
to you that Bob will be celebrating the 11:45 mass here
for the next six sundays, while sereving as an assistant
tot eh pastor of St. Patrick'S Chruch. Now our
parents will come forward to bless Bob and send him
on his mission of service to the people of God; then he will
bless them, and send us to our refreshments.
