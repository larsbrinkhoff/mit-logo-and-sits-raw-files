Please change the AI data lines
	8-6020
	8-6021
	8-6022
	8-6023
to a new set of numbers. This should be a hunt group from
8-6020 upwards, and should be charged to the main AI lab
account. Please do this immediately or sooner, as we
have been having problems with unauthorized users using these
data lines.
		thanks,
