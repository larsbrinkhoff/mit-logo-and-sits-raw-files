This is a joint user directory for members of the LOGO group listed
below:

	James Lindquist  (JCL)
	DAN Hillis	 (DANNY)

plus saved files of CLOGO.  

Files on this directory should have the format that the first file name
is a log in name of an individual listed above and the second is some
mnemonic name.  It is useful that the second name end in a number such
as CAT1 so that the > and < conventions apply.  Any files that do not
have a recognized first name will be deleted.

Do not add any files to this directory unless you have filled out
a user form and received permission.
