     This file is an outline of things one can do with op amps.  It is
intented to present things on the scale of projects.  There is another
file, ???, on small things one can do.  These are smaller ideas,
hints, and tricks.  This file is an outline of ideas for large
projects.  
     The following to be expanded in more detail. 

 
 
          
MUSIC (SYNTHESIZERS, ORGANS, AND RTSA)
 
CHEMISTRY (CYRSTAL GROWING, SECTROFATOMETRY?, IR AND UV SPECTROMETERS)

ELECTRIC DRAG RACES  
     the basic idea here is to take two kids, two motors and tow
carts, alongwith some gears and to build the fastest 'drag racer'.  I
suspose that the carts would have tobe constrained to move along a
track of some sort, but this could easily be accomplished  by eyelets
on the cart that follow a wire streched accross the room.  The problem
that is here is how to get the cart over that distance in the shortest
amount of time. 
     Yhe clearest place to start would be to somehow connect the motor
to the wheels.  Luckilly there asre all sort and sizes of gears
provided; the problem is only which one to choose.  Perhaps one might
be luchy but more likely with the first choices one of the carts will
be faster than the other.  One could experimenbt some and find the
simple, order relations: a high gearing make it start out fast but it
poops out at the fast end, while, on the other hand, a low gear couses
it to get a burst of energy at the far end but the starting
performance leaves much to be desired.  The decision now to be made is
does one solve the problem of choosing the optimal gearing by
succesive approximation, i.e. keep changing the gearing and home in on
the best, or, does one turn to theory, i.e, try to gain some insight
into the important factors and find the best way of looking at what is
present.  
     While I favor the second there is much to be said for the first.
It contains possiblities for lerning, eapecially for younger
children.  And the leatning is of an important kind.  While I would,
as adult, use the knowledge I have of a general curve with a peak in
the middle to quickly jump to the vicinity of the best ratio this is
not obvious; There is a best way of getting something by sucessive
approximations which must be learned.  One need to have a global view
while doing  local operations, for it is this global view that give
one the confidence to take the large jumps in the beginning.  
     However if this is not so much of a problem, and consewuencly not
too interesting, them one can formulate a theory.  As a sadditional
benefit a theory would be easily extendable but more about that
latter.  If you youn are acquanted with physics the theory is probably
obvious, if you aren't then you are probably as unsure as the child as
to what is happening.  This is not the place to state the physics;
that would be a paper in itself.  But I must mention that in order to
get a view of the situation that works, i.e. that gives correct
predictions, one must understand the basic concepts of position,
velicity, acceleration, and time as well as their relations, along
with ideas such as force and power.  These and some sort of theory of
motors are all involved in this deceptively simple problem.  But it is
simple, after one u_n_d_e_r_s_t_a_n_d_s_.  
     And once one u_n_d_e_r_s_t_a_n_d_s_ one can easily calculate, if not see, the
effect of varing various other constrainsts such as the lenght of the
track, the mass of the cart, the voltage avaiable to drive the motor,
etc.  in short, one has achieved a powerful technique, and thereby
gained mastery over part of the world.  
     
     (((((mention somewhere: Tweo carts are compared time is not
measured (or it could be)  One will find paradoxes such as the quickes
cart is going slower at the end.  Strange thing may happen.  Ther is
material here sutable for advanced Piaget type experienct; one can learn from teaching.
)))) 
 
     This has described the pasdics; from now on I will be sidcussing
variousramifications to the above. 
     There is a question of whether a cart should be provided to built
by the child.  In building one he would have the oppunity to learn
about friction byut mostly,from my experience, about the problems and
frsutrations of building things which have too many possiblities.  A
cart is something one could perfect only through several generations
of cart making; the mistakes don't show up until it is too late to
change them.  Perhaps one culd get around this by having some sort of
erector set type of parts which eliminates most of the serious
pitfalls while allowing rapid modifications.  But the most serious
objection is that building it himself shifts the emphasis away from
the physics.  In fact it isn't obvious to me which is the more
difficult problem, and if it is the cart building and it is too
dificultthen one misss the physcs.  And I know that the physics is the
more important.  Building the cart should I think be the problem of
building an improved version.  
     
     Finally there is a more philosophical problem that concerns me. 
I have been thinking some recently about yo-yos.  Can one build a
machine that does a yo-yo.  It is trivial but that is beside thge
pint; yo-yods are on my mind.  I also noticed that with the cart what
one needs is a gear ratio that is high to start out and then  lwers as
the speed--or distance--increased.  In a car one shifts gears but that
isn't possible here, at least not easily.  But something else is.  One
can make a variable ratio pully.  On one end the diameter of the pully
increases as the string is would onto it and th string in effect
becomes another layer of pully.  On the other end the string unwinding
decreases the lever arm.  The effect is to increase the ratio with
distance.  This with some other gears could make a drastic improvement
in the performance of the drag cart. 
     Now whileI have generally indicated how this idea came to me the
question is where do such global reconstructions come from in general.
And is there any way we can foster such `revcolutions' in
thoughts.Finally are there large differences in people with respet to
this ablity; is it sacrifices in some for other, contradictory ablities?
   
 
 
PHYSICS!!!  

ALGRBRA MACHINES, DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION MACHINES: 
     Reportedly there is a problem solving method of great power and
generallity, loved by all physics and similiar people: write a set of
differential equations and then solve them.  I'm not sure, as a
physicist, whther I believe this but it is worth looking into.  The
point of a defferential equation machine is that it can and will do
the second part of this powerful approach, and the part a true
physicist would consider the uninteresting part, solve the equations.
     And it does more that solves the equations.  It alows one to
examine them, how they work, or perhaps more approate of diff eq, how
they more. 
 

AUDIO: 
     If one takes a bunch of resistors and capacitors, and perhaps
inductors but no one useses them any more, and hooks them around an op
amp one notices all sorts of strange behavior.  What you get ut is not
what you put in.  A good problem is how to describe this.  If fact
only a few capacitors will give interesting phenomona.
     This could be a project.  But there is more.  The same ideas and
concepts that apply to this area apply to a a much larger and divese
number of disciplins.  It is as basic as sine waves, whether they
are simple pendulums or radio waves.  But first, what could a child
do? 
     Plenty.  One of the standard domains to express the behaviour of
networks is the frequency domain.  Keeping the input a_m_p_l_i_t_u_d_e_
constant one varies the f_r_e_q_u_e_n_c_y_ and records the a_m_p_l_i_t_u_d_e_ of the
output. If one plots the log of the output versus the log of the
frequency (input amplitude constant) one get nice results--stright
lines.  Moreover the lines can be easily related to the values of the
components chosed.  And one can change the components to get any response one
wants.  The problem is that all this plotting on log-log paper is slow
and soon boring.   But op amps come to the rescue. 
     What would be nice to have is a device that one could hook up to
the network and would then display this graph on a CRT type display. 
Then one could instantly see the effect of varying things, and within
a short time develope a working knowledge of what is going on.  Shall
we say an intuition?  At the very least one could quickly test
predictions and guesses.
