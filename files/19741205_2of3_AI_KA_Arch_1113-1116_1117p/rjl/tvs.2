This tries to be a summary of
	a) what we know we want and how much it costs
	b) what the cost ranges are on things we don't know about yet
	c) what critical paths exist
	d) what choices we have

1. Vidieo generation
	We plan on coping Knight's systemm almost exactly, except that
the Superbus which connects all the memories to the processor(s) will
be 32 bits wide instead of 16, so that if we decide to build a fast
bit-map generator sometime in the future, we will have reasonable
bandwidth to the merory. I believe that the current plan is to produce
4 channels, which costs:

Intel memory, 4*16k*16			$10,800
Augat board, wired			$600
Dec rack				$200
Relay rack				$400
Chips					$250
PDP11 interface				$400
Misc					$200
					_______
					$12,850
Probably the longest order time on this stuff is for the Intel
memory, which is 60-75 days, but I don't know about the Augat board.
Wiring all this stuff together will take on the order of 5 days
of Carl Waldrop's time, if we can negotiate with whoever to get him
to do it.
	Generating color video (RGB) from the black and white
video will be accomplished fairly straightforwardly by means of a
color map. This is composed of 3 64 by 8 bit memories whose
address bits are driven by up to 6 black and white channels
and whose outputs drive 3 DACs, one for each color.
The memories are loadable from the computer. Tom Knight and I are
currently investigating suitable DACs, which have to be
damn fast to do the job. Aproximate cost:

Chips					$100
DACs					$450
Misc					$100
					____
					$650
2) Monitors and keyboards
	There are some descions which have to be made here, and
in the case of keyboards they better be made fast. If we order
custom keyboards from Microswitch, we will have to wait about
5-6 months for them to get here. Also, custom keyboards cost
more (Knight's cost 211 each plus a 955 setup charge, standard
ascii keyboards cost about $120). The setup charge is largely
dependent on how many keytops you want that they don't have in
stock. I will try to find out what is available from stock.
	As for monitors, I think it is fairly clear that we want
to get the same ones Knight got. The phosphor is a win because
it doesn't flicker, and also there are about 5 cabinets left over
from Knight's system for them. We also should get the Advent Videobeam,
and we might want to consider a gray scale monitor, since the color
map could easily produce gray scales.
	One other thing that has to be decided about consoles
is how many we want to get. Probably if we can afford it we should
get about 10, since there is usually a price break at that quantity,
and we will probably want that many anyway. About my best estimate
of cost per console is $550.
	We can interface the keyboards using the (ugh) old DM11 or
the DH11. If we plan on having lots (>5 for DH11, >16 for DM11)
of consoles connected, we may want to get a Freeman keyboard interface.
I am assuming that won't be nessesary.


10 Consoles @$550				$5500
Advent Videobeam				$2500
Cables, etc.					$300
						_____
						$7800

3) Switching
	We probably want to make a video switch like Knight's.
This is pretty easy to do since all that is involved is
getting the proper PC cards made (comercially) and wiring
it up.

Video switch					$1000
4) Total
Video						$12,850
Consoles					$7800
Switching					$1000
						______
						$21,650
This figure does not include any labor, and should probably
be considered the lower limit for the cost of the hardware we want.
