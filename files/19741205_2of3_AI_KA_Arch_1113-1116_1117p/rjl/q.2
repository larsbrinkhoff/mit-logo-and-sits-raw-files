The PDP-8 ESR Averager
	This document describes a program written for Boston
College's Chemistry Deptarment PDP-8 for the purpose of
averaging signals recieved by their ESR, and displaying,
storing and evaluating these averages.
	The program uses the teletype, the a/d converter, the
real time clock (trigger inputs), the x-y display and two
fields of memory. When it is first started, it resets a few
internal variables and goes into the normal signal display/
command accepting mode. In general, it i safe to restart the
program at any time. This can be done mannualy, by starting it
at address 200, or under keyboard control, by typing "*".
(note that the quotes are not typed, just the asterisk).
Unless something is wrong, typing "*" should work
whenever the program is running (execption: while the program
is reading a paper tape, or thinks it is reading a papertape
the program can only be restarted manually)
Note that the "*" is not echoed, since restaring the program
stops any teletype output; if the program is for some
reason being long-winded, "*" may be typed. Whenever
the computer is not occupied with some other task, it
displays the current signal. Starting or restarting
the program never disturbs the current signal; if you
wish to zero it you must do so explictly by typing "Z".
Normally the display parameters are adjusted by the program
to make the signal fit on the screen, and in general look nice.
If for some reason the signal is not so adjusted, the
command "+" will cause it to be.
	The prgram has several modes. The mode the program is
in determines what is displayed and what else is going on.
As already mentioned, the program starts up in a mode
where it accepts commands and displays the current
signal; this is the idle mode. The program acctually
accepts commands in any mode except paper-tape reading mode.
The other modes are: papertape punching mode, adjust mode,
kaliedescope mode, and signal averageing mode.
In kaliedscope mode (entered by typing "K") the program
displays on the screen the results of DEC's kaliedscope
program; the display is modified by the low order 3 or 4
bits of the switch register. This is mostly useful
for adjusting the scope and showing visitors how useful
your computer is. Adjust mode (entered by typeing "A")
allows you to adjust the shimitt triggers and a to d
input in preparation for averaging a signal. In this mode,
a dot is displayed on the screen whose y position cooresponds
to the voltage input to a/d channel zero. The x position
is incremented one to the right every time the trigger
which is supposed to be connected to the esr's internal clock
triggers. Every time the trigger which is supposed to be connected
to the left limit switch triggers the teletype bell will ring.
(except that if it triggers more than 10 times/second, the bell
will only ring 10 times/sec.)
	The program is capable of saving the results
it gathers on papertape and reading them back at some latter time.
papertape is punched by typing "P". The machine will imediately
halt to remind you to turn on the tape punch. It will then punch
out some leader tape, a start mark, the current settings of variables,
the current signal and some trailer tape, in that order. Note
that while the tape is being punched, the teletype might
type strange things; this is because the tape is not punched
in ascii but rather is punched in a special binary format.
While the tape is being punched the current
signal is displayed; you may stop the punching by typing "*".
The tape which was punched out may be read back in by placeing
it in the reader (making sure that you put the leader over
the read head) and typing "R". Until the tape is fully read,
the only way to stop this process is to manually restart the program.
If the tape is installed wrong or is faulty, the program may
go throught the whole tape and still expect to read more;
if this happens the program has probably managed to clobber
itself and you'll have to reload it. Note that when
you place the tape in the reader you should put the reader
switch into the "start" position. The tape will not be moved
until you type "R". If you forget to put it into the start
positon and type "R", nothing will happen; at that point
you can put it to start and type any character except rubout
to get it going (rubout will cause disaster). While the program
reads past the leader and reads in
the variables, the screen is blank. When it begins reading in the
signal values, it displays the new signal on the screen as
it is read in.
