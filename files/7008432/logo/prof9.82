19. Jimmy

Jimmy is considered to be an above average student by his teachers.
His national achievement test scores place him in the 57th percentile.
 Although he is considered bright, Jimmy is extremely selective in
applying himself to regular class work.  He tends to excel in areas
which appeal to him, and offers resistance to assignments which he does
not consider "interesting".

11. Jimmy's Working Style

0In the LOGO classes, his work was also somewhat ideosyncratic.  He
quickly became expert at "TURTLE driving," and created one of the most
elaborate drawings of any of our students.  His procedure, to draw a
robot, patterned on the Starwars character, R2D2, was extremely
detailed and intricate, and was drawn with uncommon care and patience.
On the other hand, Jimmy had great difficulty understanding how to make
use of subprocedures in a way that made his work easier.  He conceived
of each projects as a long, almost endless string of commands;
subprocedures were just a way of breaking a project into pieces that
could be accomplished in a short time.  It was not until near the end
of the classes that Jimmy began to make use of subprocedures for
planning.  Debugging remained a mystery for him.

Drawing a Boat
.block 5
12. Jimmy's Sailboat Project

0Jimmy's first project, after learning the basic LOGO commands, was
to use the TURTLE to draw a sailboat.  He drew his boat step by step on
the screen, and copied the entire list of commands to make the
procedures, BODY and SAIL.  Although he copied steps literally, in a
style similar to Deborah's, he was also able to make good use of
geometric knowledge.  Lines 2, 3, and 4 of his BODY procedure, which
draw the prow of his boat, offer an example of how he was able to use a
180 degree angle to reverse the TURTLE's direction.  Line's 12 and 13
show how he corrected a mistaken RIGHT 89, by doubling 89, and
following it by the command LEFT 178.  It is characteristic of Jimmy's
work that he did not replace both commands by one correct LEFT 89, but
kept both his original commands as part of his procedure.

Drawing a Robot

13. 0Jimmy's next major project, on which he worked for five class
periods (approximately 6 1/2 hours), was his drawing of a robot (figure
9.2).

Figure 9.2

Jimmy's superprocedure, ADAM, made use of ten different subprocedures,
to draw the robot.  Jimmy worked on the project in an exploratory
fashion.  When he had successfully drawn one part of the robot on the
screen, he would write down all the steps on the text display screen,
and give that part of his drawing a name.  When he began working again,
he would include the procedure he had just defined, as the first step
of his next procedure.  Jimmy's procedure hierarchy can be described as
a "tree", with no "branch" containing more than two "sub-branches".

The role of each of the subprocedures can be traced by starting at the
bottom of the tree, and working upward:

R2 draws the rectangle which made up most of the robot's body.

LEG1 draws the right leg.

R2D2 includes R2 and LEG1 and then adds the left leg.

JOE draws one 30-by-5 rectangle on the right of the robot.

DOG includes R2D2 and JOE nd adds another small rectangle.

D2 includes DOG and adds the two larger rectangles.

L1 draws a single line on the lower left of the robot

JP includes D2 and four repeats of L1.  It draws the entire robot,
except for the eye.

BOX drwas a small square in the robot's head.

EYE1 includes BOX and draws the eye in the center of the box.

ADAM includes JP and EYE1.  It draws the entire robot, moves the TURTLe
over and draws the eye.

Drawing a Rocket
.block 5
14. Jimmy's Rocket Project

0Jimmy's next major project, although visually much simpler than the
robot, also took five class periods to work out.  The complexity of
this project lay in the use of angles other than ninety degrees.  This
required Jimmy to pay careful attention to TURTLE's state at each point
of the process, in order to draw a symmetrical design. (Figure 9.3)

.block 17
.sp 15
.ce
Figure 9.3

Jimmy's hierarchical "tree" was a lot simpler this time:

.nofill
.block 7
		R

	RFIN	FIN2	ROCKET

	J

STICK	CONE
.adjust

.indent 6
STICK draws the rocket's body.

CONE draws the nose cone.

J combines CONE and STICK and draws the entire rocket.

RFIN includes J and adds the upper right fin.

FIN2 draws the lower right fin.

ROCKET draws both left fins.

R includes RFIN, FIN2 and ROCKET, and draws the entire rocket.

.indent 0
In drawing the rocket, Jimmy constructed the upper right fin by trial
and error.  He then copied it three more times, paying careful
attention to right/left symmetry.  (The lower left fin came out a
little too large because of a miscalculation).

Jimmy developed an interesting solution to the problem of drawing the
rocket's nose cone -- an isoceles triangle with a fixed base.  His
strategy was to start at point A (figure 9.4), turn the TURTLe RIGHT 15
degrees, move it forward a certain distance, and then back the same
distance.  Making use of symmetry, Jimmy then moved the TURTLE to pint
B, turned the TURTLE LEFT 15, and moved it forward and back the
same distance.  His problem was that he did not know the distance
to use.  The teacher suggested that he make that length a variable, and
together they talked through the procedure:

.nofill
.block 15
TO CONE :LEN
5 FORWARD 100
10 RIGHT 15
15 FORWARD :LEN
20 BACK :LEN
25 RIGHT 75

35 LEFT 90
40 LEFT 15
45 FORWARD :LEN
50 BACK :LEN
55 RIGHT 15
END
.ri
Figure 9.4

.adjust
Jimmy then used the CONE procedure several times to determine the
correct length.

There are clues in the CONE procedure to the way that Jimmy made use of
"units" of 90 degrees in thinking about his drawing.  He turned the
TURTLE RIGHT 15 at line 10.  Line 25 added the additional rotation,
RIGHT 75, to make a total of 90 degrees, allowing the TURTLE to move
from point A to point B.  Having reached point B, Jimmy turned the
TURTLE LEFT 90, and added the step, LEFT 15.  The fact that he was
thinking in terms of 90o units was confirmed by his failure to
combine the two as one step, LEFT 105.

Racetrack Project
15. Jimmy's Racetrack Project

0During the last few classes, Jimmy concentrated on working with
Dynaturtle activities.  Part of his work with Dynaturtle is described
in detail in Chapter 6 of Part II of this report.  A racetrack project
that Jimmy carried out in connection with dynamic activities gives
another indication of the way in which he incorporated geometric ideas
into his work in Turtle Geometry.

Jimmy was drawing a "racetrack" for the Dynaturtle to move around.  He
had decided to draw an oval track, and had completed drawing the inside
of the track.  To draw the ends of the inside of the track, Jimmy made
repeated use of RARC 40 commands (Figure 9.5).  To draw the outside of
the track, he moved the TURTLe over 40 TURTLe steps, and drew the
outside using RARC 80 commands (Figure 9.6).  When an observer asked
Jimmy how he knew that RARC 80 would draw the correct sized arcs, Jimmy
answered that using an RARC 80 command was "just like making a corner
with sides of 80." This indicated that he understood how to replace the
effect of the RARC command by an equivalent one which made it easy for
him to calculate the necessary distance (Figure 9.7).
