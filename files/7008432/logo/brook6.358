13. The Experience of Exceptional Children in the LOGO Learning
Environment 

0One of the most striking results of the Brookline LOGO experiment
has been the success experienced by exceptional students.  We include within
the category "exceptional," two groups of students whose education often
poses problems within conventional elementary school programs --
intellectually gifted students, and students with significant learning
disabilities.  While the educational difficulties encountered by these
groups of students differ markedly, both groups experience difficulties related to
their inclusion in educational programs designed primarily for
average students.  

Faced with a choice between mainstreaming these students, and isolating
them in special programs, schools have usually decided that the
disadvantages of isolation outweigh the possible advantages of
specialized programs.  Even when educational programs are partially
individualized teachers continually confront the task of providing
challenges and enrichment for gifted students and tutorial and remedial
help for the learning disabled, while including them in an overall
academic program designed for students of an average range of
abilities.  The successful LOGO experiences of exceptional students,
working side by side with students of average ability, indicates that a
LOGO learning environment may prove useful to schools in meeting the
problems posed in educating these students.

Gary: Learning Style
It should not be surprising that intellectually gifted students were
successful in LOGO classes -- many computer education programs have
been targeted for bright students have generally been
successful in learning to program computers.  What is surprising is
that the students with the lowest level of previous academic success
should also be successful in an educational context involving a full
range of students working together.  In this chapter we will describe
the work of three exceptional students, Gary, Karl and Tina.  Gary
was one of three students, in our experimental sample of sixteen
students who are considered "gifted" by their teachers.
Karl and Tina are two of the three students in
our experimental sample who have been diagnosed as having "learning
disabilities," and who receive a minimum of one hour of specialized
one-to-one tutoring each day.

11.  The Work of Gary -- An "Intellectually Gifted" Student

0Of all our experimental subjects, Gary seemed the most predisposed
to success in LOGO.  Combining a strong prior interest in computers
with a learning style that encompassed both analytical and
trial-and-error approaches, Gary was able to successfully carry out
projects in a number of different areas.

Gary had had some previous exposure to computers, had attended a
personal computer fair, and had been pressuring his parents to buy
him a computer.  He absorbed new ideas voraciously, and rarely had to
be shown something twice.  He tackled extremely ambitious projects, and
always stayed with a project until some kind of completion was achieved.

.block 5
11.1 Gary's Learning Style as Seen Through his LOGO Work

0Gary's work demonstrated some clear characteristics that set him
apart from most of the other students:

Gary easily understood the use of a procedure as an entity, recognizing
the usefulness of naming a series of steps, and thereafter considering
them as a "unit"; he often wrote procedures without trying out the
steps individually first, recognizing that the series of steps could be
considered to have a "total effect," as though it were a single command.

Gary had faith in his ability to solve problems by reasoning as well
as trial-and-error.  He was constantly trying things out "in his head",
making use of a number of "abstract principles" to simplify and debug
his work as he went along:  A series of FORWARD and BACK commands would
easily be combined into one command; left/right reversibility would be
used to correct an error.  At one point, for example, Gary had typed
RIGHT 99, and saw from the effect that he should have used LEFT 99.  He
then used the computer to add 99 + 99, and typed LEFT 198.  In writing
his procedure later, he simply used the correct command LEFT 99,
without ever having tried it explicitly.

Gary tended to "plunge into a problem" impetuously, with very little
advance planning, drawing on a quick analysis, based on partially
understood ideas.  He then enjoyed the process of debugging his
original idea, or of moving in a new direction, if his result was
significantly different from what he had intended.  In the first class,
Gary noticed that repeating a simple three step procedure made a
"pattern" that looked something like a "circle".  When another student
suggested making a smaller circle inside the first one, Gary began to
make a new circle by using the same procedure with smaller inputs.
When his new circle came out larger than the original one, Gary was
delighted by the surprise.  He then tested another approach -- make all
the inputs exactly half of the original, which led to a "circle" of
almost the same size as his first one.  And so on, until he had tried
many variations.

.he2
Gary: Drawing a Face
Gary tended to work in a step-by-step fashion, rather than make use of
planning.  While he generally had an overall idea of what he was
trying to do, he tended to incorporate subprocedures one after another,
rather than to break down his problem into parts and plan his
subprocedures in advance.  He showed that he was capable of using a
more structured approach when he was asked by his teacher to rewrite
his STARSHIP procedure -- he created a set of simple modular
subprocedures to draw his starship design. 

Gary often sought out bugs, testing for extreme situations:  the
largest possible inputs, the largest number of REPEATs, situations
which would produce error messages, as a way of understanding both the
capabilities and limitations of the computer, beyond the needs of any
specific project on which he was working.

Gary's work was usually directed toward ambitious goals.  He
worked on four major projects, during his seven weeks of LOGO classes.
While he enjoyed brief detours, such as the "circle" exploration
described above, his work was usually directed quite specifically at
his particular immediate goal.  Between projects, he often appeared to be
restless; once a new task was selected, he was off and running again.

.block 5
11.2 Gary's LOGO Projects

0Gary carried out four major projects, the last of which was still in
process when the series of classes ended:  a rather elaborate "face"
built from a large number of subprocedures; an interactive "math quiz"
which gave a user a series of two-digit addition problems; a computer
animated "starship"
design; and a "morse code translator"
which was intended to translate a printed sentence into a line
of morse code, and vice-versa.

His FACE project involved learning to use a large number of
sub-procedures, and a great deal of Turtle Geometry -- especially arc
and circle procedures.  Gary used functional procedure names,
abbreviated procedure names, and "nonsense" names, all in a rather
elbaorate scheme to "hide" the sub-procedures which actually "did the
job". (See figure 1.1) Of course, this complex set of subprocedures was
extremely difficult for Gary himself to debug, and he often had to
trace through the entire "tree structure" of his project to find a
bug in a particular procedure.

Gary's second project, a math quiz, involved the use of conditionals,
PRINT statements, the naming of variables, and random numbers.
Although he planned to extend the project to include subtraction,
multiplication and division, he decided to go on to other activities
after completing the addition portion of the quiz.*

Gary's Starship project involved Turtle Geometry once again. (See fig.
1.2) In order to avoid the type of debugging problems he encountered
in his FACE project, Gary decided to carry out his starship project by
writing one long procedure.  This led to a large number of
unanticipated bugs as well.  Although Gary successfully debugged his
lengthy procedure, his teacher suggested that he redo his starship
project, making use of simple procedures and subprocedures.  This time,
having experienced both extremes -- an unnecessarily complex hierarchy
of subprocedures, and an unnecessarily long single procedure, Gary
developed a
set of modular, easily readable and easily debugged subprocedures to
carry out his STARSHIP design.

completed it, making use of a LOGO computer provided by his school system.

0For his last project, Gary decided to create a Morse Code Translator as
the first step of a project to actually transmit morse code over radio
waves, which he had read about in a computer hobbyist magazine.  In
creating the Morse Code translator he had to make use of LOGO's list
and word processing capabilities; of recursive procedures which used
the concept of the empty word" and the "empty list" in STOP rules, and
of conditionals which were used to decide which particular set of Morse
Code symbols to output.  (This set of procedures is discussed more
fully in Chapter 4, Section 7.3.4)

.block 5
11.3 Conclusions

0Gary absorbed a great deal in approximately 25 hours of LOGO
classes.  His projects involved a number of different content areas:
Turtle Geometry, Interactive programming, animation, list processing,
etc.  His enthusiasm remained at a fever pitch throughout the series of
classes.  When the cycle of LOGO classes was finished, Gary helped
establish an after school "computer club," so that he could carry on
his work.

The computer activities provided the kind of challenge and scope of
intellectual activities that Gary wanted and needed to develop his
abilities most fully.  The fact that this challenge and
scope was not always present his regular classes was attested to
frequently by his classroom teachers.  A LOGO capability in a
classroom could help teachers meet the needs of students
like Gary.

12. The Work of Karl:  A Severely Learning-Disabled Student

0Karl is a student who has been diagnosed by the school staff as
having severe learning disabilities.  Related to his difficulties in
reading, writing and arithmetic, are readily observable hearing, speech
and motor ability problems which interfere with communication.  Karl
who is large for his age and somewhat awkward in manner, has few
friends among his classmates other than two or three selected "cronies."

In his LOGO work Karl demonstrated the ability to plan and carry out
complex projects involving several subprocedures, to understand
geometric concepts, to carry out mathematical calculations in his head,
and to work in both a well organized step-by-step fashion and in an
open-ended exploratory mode.  While Karl often needed help with routine
tasks such as remembering the spelling of LOGO commands, he was able to
make use of reasoning abilities that allowed him to surpass in the LOGO
classes what he was normally able to accomplish in either his regular
classes or his special tutoring sessions.

.block 5
12.1  Karl's Working Style in the LOGO Classes

0Karl enjoyed the sense of control and accomplishment that he
experienced in the LOGO classes.  He had to overcome severe typing and
spelling problems, and to find ways of organizing his work, in order to
achieve this success.  While spelling and typing difficulties made his
work much slower and more painful than that of his peers, they did not
seem to dampen his enthusiasm or impede his learning process.

Karl's work alternated between carefully planned geometric designs and
a more random, exploratory use of commands that he did not fully
understand.  As he began to discover consistencies in the effects
produced by different commands, he gradually came to exercise more
purposeful control over the outcomes of all his work.

Karl created a number of planned geometric designs making use of
direct commands and previously defined procedures.  Once a procedure
was completed, however, he enjoyed combining procedures and SPIN
commands randomly to see the effect.  He would then sit for long
periods of time watching the different combinations.  As the classes
went on, he came to have more and more interest in controlling the
designs, planning his combinations more carefully, and even editing one
of his "conglomerate" procedures so that random effects were
systematically eliminated.

Karl developed an experimental approach to using the computer system
and the LOGO language -- he would "ask questions of the computer" by
trying things and seeing what happened.  He used a method of successive
approximations to find the largest possible input to a SPIN command,
and to determine the limits of the TURTLE screen.  He found the
shortest procedure name (one letter) and the "longest"
(QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM).  He experimented with the adding and
subtracting of extremely long numbers, to test the computer's limits in
doing arithmetic.  Karl also made a point of learning to use all the
peripheral devices that were part of the computer system:  the Floor
TURTLE, plotter and printer.  Although seemingly random, it is clear
that these explorations were an important part of his effort to
establish control over the environment in which he was working.

Karl made a major effort to exercise control over his typing
difficulties as well.  His typing was characterized by a painfully slow
and poorly coordinated approach to using the keyboard.  When he wanted
to find a particular letter on the keyboard, he would scan with his
eyes, moving his index finger back and forth, as his eyes shifted.
Often his finger would pass the correct key several times before
hitting it.  If a wrong key was hit, an error message would result, and
the whole process would begin again.  Although he gradually improved
his typing, he continued to have difficulty finding familiar keys.

Karl used the same random scanning strategy for finding numbers.
Although he knew that the numbers were on the top line of the keyboard,
he was unable to make use of their inherent order to make them easier
to find.  This was particularly striking when he was numbering steps in
a procedure.  Going in a sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, ... he conducted an
individual "search" for each number, using his scanning and finger
moving technique.

Karl also had difficulty reading error messages and spelling LOGO
commands.  Although he was gradually able to include the new
terminology in his sight vocabulary, he was unable to sound out words,
even though he had seen them before.  He either "knew" a word, or could
not read it.  Before long, he had become familiar with the most common
commands and error messages, and knew how to respond to them.  He
continued to have a problem whenever an unfamiliar error message appeared.

Karl developed his own strategies for overcoming these problems.  He
learned to write short procedure names and abbreviations for commonly
used LOGO commands.  He kept a notebook of all the commands and
procedures that he had learned or created, so that he could easzily
find the correct spelling if he couldn't remember it.  At one point he
named a procedure QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM, utliizing every letter of
the alphabet, in their sequence on the keyboard.  Since he could move
his finger in order across all the letters, this procedure name
required no scanning and was easier for Karl to type than even a three
letter procedure name such as TAM, which required scanning.

.he2
Karl: Early Projects
One of the Karl's major activities was an animated "car" project in
which the TURTLE moved continuously, while it's motion could be altered
interactively as the user typed certain keys on the keyboard.  The
letters he used to control the motion of the turtle -- Q W E R A S and
F -- are all located in a group on the left hand end of the keyboard.
Originally he had planned to make a cardboard cover for the keyboard,
with a hole cut in it so that only those letters could be seen.  He
found this to be unnecessary, however.  By concentrating his attention
on one small corner of the keyboard, he was able to select the correct
keys easily, without any of the scanning or memory problems that
occurred when he had the entire keyboard as his field.

.block 5
12.2  Some Examples of Karl's Work

0Karl's earliest LOGO procedures were simple geometric designs.  His
first project, TAM, was a rectangle, and the second, CULL, resulted from
repeating TAM four times.  His third project, ACE, made use
of symmetry, and the properties of circles in a carefully planned format.

Having completed these designs, Karl's work entered a phase in which he
created wildly spinning designs by random accumulation of previously
defined procedures.  ACE2, ME, and ACE3 are examples of this type of
procedure which culminated in the procedure BU:

12.3  Karl's Animation Project

0Karl's major accomplishment was a set of procedures which 
animated the turtle in such a way that he could "drive it around" on the
display screen.  He was given the initial concepts for the procedures
and filled in the specific instructions himself.  The procedure ideas
he was given were.

(The command KEY was given as a "primitive" which "tells the computer
which letter you type on the keyboard.")

Using this basic idea.  Karl was able to define his own system of
commands to control the TURTLE's motion:

40 GO 20	70 IF :LETTER = "Q PENDOWN
END		80 IF :LETTER = "E MAKE "D 0
		END

.adjust
The letters "R" (right turn), "F" (faster), "S" (slower), and "E"
(emergency stop), all are abbreviations for their functions while the
letters "W", "A" and "Q" were chosen for their position on the keyboard.

Using these seven keys Karl could turn the TURTLE in any direction,
make it speed up, slow down, or stop, and could decide whether the
TURTLE should draw a line as it moved.  Karl discovered that repeatedly
pressing "S" would slow the TURTLE down, and eventually make it move
backwards.  By alternating between the "A" and "Q" keys he could make
the TURTLE draw dotted lines.  By slowing the TURTLE down and carefully
controlling its direction, he found he could use this device to create
interesting free-form designs, or to write his name in script.

.he2
Karl: Affective Aspects
.block 5
12.4.  Affective Aspects of Karl's LOGO Experience

0At the beginning of the LOGO classes, Karl tended to have a
"deadpan" expression at all times.  This corresponded to his appearance
when seen for interviews, or on random occasions throughout the school.
Even when he was successful in using the computer for the first few
sessions, his expression continued to be blank and non-committal.

As he began to feel successful, Karl became more assertive and curious.
He asked what error messages meant, and sought to understand how to use
new commands.  He made a point of finding out how to use the Plotter
and Printer, so that he could make his own "hard copy" of his computer
work.  At about the same time, he began to express an interest in the
work of other children, and to show them his work.  He
invited a friend to class and swapped programs with him, his behavior
demonstrating that he was feeling good and enjoying himself.  His face
was becoming more expressive, his posture more relaxed.

Changes in Karl's atitude toward his classroom work were noted by his
regular teacher.  She reported that he was beginning to show that he
really cared about his school work, that he had begun concentrating on
his work in a way that she had not seen before, and that he seemed to
have a great deal more confidence in his ability to carry out academic
tasks.  She attributed these changes directly to his feeling of success
in the LOGO classes.

Karl's success in his LOGO classes demonstrated that with an
appropriate educational environment, he was able to function at a
higher level of ability than he had demonstrated in schoolwork, even
with a great deal of one-to-one tutoring.

By the time of his final interview, after the end of the LOGO classes,
Karl had become significantly more articulate.  He listed ten uses for
a tin can (as opposed to four uses for a brick in the first interview).
Instead of carrying out the four color permutation task, he asked "Can
I just show you how I do it?"  and proceeded to describe a system for
finding six permutations that started with each of four colors.  With
some difficulty, he correctly calculated that there were twenty four
possibilities in all, and leaning over to speak directly into the
interviewer's tape recorder, he said: "Twenty-four.  I'm a brain!"

Tina: Attitude Toward Computer
.block 5
13.  The Work of Tina:  A Learning-Disabled Student

0Tina is a student with severe learning disabilities, whose academic
abilities are extremely low compared with her classmates.  Like Karl
whose work was described above, she was successful in the LOGO
classes, making use of abilities that she was not using to full
advantage in her regular classes, or in her daily one-to-one tutoring
sessions. 

Tina's pattern of computer use was unique among our sixteen
experimental subjects in that she was not interested in Turtle Geometry
and never learned to write her own LOGO procedures.  On the other hand,
Tina established an intense, personal relationship with the computer,
and, using the computer as a text editor and word processor wrote a
series of stories that represented a major achievement in the area of
creative writing.

.block 5
13.1  Tina's Attitude Toward the Computer

0In the first class Tina established a special relationship with
one of the four computers.  She personalized it by giving it a name,
Peter, and behaving toward the computer in much the same way a child
might behave toward a favorite doll, pet, or a much younger
child.  Tina was extremely possessive of the computer she called
"Peter", and would not allow other students to use that particular
machine during her classes.

In the early classes Tina made a number of efforts to communicate with
the computer, typing questions such as "What's your name?" and
responding angrily to error messages with messages of her own.

Gradually, Tina's relationship with the computer tempered somewhat.
She was shown how to make the computer communicate, and was helped
to write the procedure, WHO:

.nofill
TO WHO
1 PRINT [MY NAME IS PETER]
END

.he2
Writing Stories
.adjust
The teacher continually stressed the fact that the computer was a "dumb
machine", controlled by Tina and her friends, as well as by the teacher
and other programmers.  
Tina eventually developed a
more balanced understanding of her role in relation to the computer.
Her behavior with the computer became much more matter-of-fact, and
although she continued to share credit with "Peter" for her
accomplishments, she no longer expressed anger at error messages.  As
she came to understand the mechanical predictability of the computer's
responses to her, and as she began to take more pride in her own
accomplishments, "Peter" came more and more to take on the status of a
personal fantasy -- one which a child knows is a fantasy, but
persists in "playing" sometimes because it's fun.

In her actual work with the computer, Tina had some ideosyncrasies that
differentiated her from other students.  Although she had a great deal
of difficulty starting work at the beginning of a class period, Tina
insisted on completing any task before the end of the period.  Her work
often ended with a rush, or with requests to stay late to finish up.
Once a class ended, she never returned to a task
regardless of its
actual state of completion.

Tina also had a need to have all her work be "correct".
When she made a typing error, or received an error message, Tina would clear
the screen immediately by typing a long series of carriage returns.
This habit interfered with her learning, as it prevented her from
maintaining continuity in her work, and elminated the possibility of an
appropriate response to an error message.  Even completed stories were
often removed from the screen before they could be read, much less
responded to.

In addition to her compulsive aversion to errors, Tina had a strong
desire for neatness.  She regularly straightened up the LOGO classroom,
reminding other children to put their things away, etc.  She loved the
printed copies of her work, and always made multiple copies to give to
her friends, family and teachers.

Tina: Writing Stories
.block 5
13.2  Tina's Use of the Computer as an Editor

0Tina devoted most of her time and effort in the LOGO classes to
writing, editing and printing copies of a series of "stories" that she
wrote.  A special program, LETTER, was created for her use, allowing
her to type a story directly into the computer without having to write
a procedure or use PRINT commands.  She used this procedure to write
two "letters" and seven "stories" during the course of the LOGO
classes.  At least three additional stories were discarded without
being finished.

Tina wrote about people who were part of her life.  Her first two
letters were to her aunt and her mother; Tommy, Ann, Sonny, and Donell,
subjects of her stories are all Tina's relatives.  Harriet, Mr. Lewis
and Miss Hirsh, are a classmate and two of her teachers.  Each story
was written during one class period,
and was never continued or changed, once it had been
finished.

The letter, HELEN, is representative of Tina's first two attempts to
use the computer for writing:

2DEAR HELEN HOW ARE YOU IN YOUR NEW HOME.  I AM GOING TO GET YOU SOMETHING
 FOR YOUR NEW HOME .AS SOON AS I GET MY MONEY
LOVE TINA

0In writing this letter Tina regularly asked for spelling and
punctuation help.  She was concerned that it be gramatically correct,
and in proper form.  A great deal of time was spent making sure each
line was correct, before going on to the next.

Once she shifted from writing letters to stories, Tina became less concerned with
spelling and grammar (although she continued to ask for help in these
areas).  Instead, she was more concerned with the details of the story:
the names of the characters, the places they lived, the sequence of
events, and the feelings of the characters involved.  Tina had deep
feelings about her subject matter.  Her story, SONNY, is typical of
her style and intensity of feeling:

2SONNY IS A LITTLE BOY HE LIVES WITH HIS AUNT HELEN IN CALIFORNIA
HE HAS BEEN LIVE WITH HER FOR 9 YEARS.  HE IS GOING TO A HOME FOR
LITTLE WONDERS 4 WEEKS AFTER THAT TO
COUPLE A ADOPTED SONNY HE WAS THE HAPPIEST BOY THAT YOU EVERY
SEEN.  I GUESS IF THAT WAS ME I WOULD BE HAPPY IF SOME ONE WOULD
ADOPT.  BUT SEE I AM NOT ADOPT I HAVE MY ON MOTHER AND I AM
GLAD THAT I HAVE MY ON MOTHER.BECAUSE THE KIDS THAT HAVE FEELS
REALLY BAD. THAT'S WHY ALL THE KIDS IN THE WORLD SHOULD BE
GRATEFUL TO THEIR PARENTS. THE END.

0After Tina had completed SONNY, her fifth piece of writing, 
0she was asked for some samples of writing done in class.  "I don't have
time to write stories in class," was her reply.  "I've got too much
work to do."  Tina's English teacher and her learning disabilities
teacher confirmed the fact that she had done virtually no creative
writing in school during the year.  Her English teacher explained that
she rarely completed any work, and pointed out that her computer
stories were among her first finished pieces of work.

After completing each of her stories, Tina printed out between ten and
twelve copies to be distributed to her friends, family and teachers.
The widespread distribution of her stories was an indication of the
pride and satisfaction she felt in her work.

We have attempt to determine the reasons for Tina's success at writing
with a computer when many other approaches  had resulted
in failure.  While our findings are somewhat speculative, we feel that
we can offer the following insights:

.block 3
.indent 6
1--0Tina is fanatic about work being "complete" and free of errors.
Using the computer, she could rubout her errors as they occurred, and
correct them without destroying all her previous work.  Once she
declared a story "finished" she never proofread it or looked back to
see if she could find any other errors.

.block 3
1--0The teacher in the LOGO classes offered no correction or
criticism of her work, limiting his role to answering her questions
about spelling, punctuation and grammar.  

.block 3
1--0The printed computer output had a "professional" quality that
Tina liked. She could give away as many copies as she wanted -- thus
obtaining positive feedback about her writing from many different people.

.block 3
1--0Tina felt that her work was unique, special, and competent.
Since only Tina was writing stories using the LETTER proram, she did
not have to compare her work with that of any other students.

.indent 0
The combination of these and other factors
produced a profound effect on Tina that was apparent to everyone who
dealt with her
outside of the LOGO classes.  Having taken pride in her
computer stories, Tina became more conscientious about her other school
work, beginning to complete assignments consistently for the first time
all year.  Having been accepted by the other children in her LOGO
class, her "social position" within her class as a whole improved.
Thus, although Tina's LOGO experience was perhaps the least
conventional  of all the students, it seems to have been possibly the most profound.
