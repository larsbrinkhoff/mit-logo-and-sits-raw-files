1Laura

0Laura is considered to be an average student by her teachers.  (On
her most recently recorded school achievement tests, however, her
national percentile ranking was 73.)  Laura got off to a good start in
her LOGO work, quickly mastering the basic turtle commands, and the use
of procedures and subprocedures.  By session 8 she had completed a
substantial project -- drawing a face using a top-down program
structure with subprocedures.

She worked really well for three or four more
sessions -- after which her work bogged down a bit as
several new ideas were introduced in close succession, and the projects she 
was trying to do
became harder.  From that point, her rate of progress was noticeably slowed.

11. Laura's Working Style

0Laura had a tendency to try to learn quickly.  She wanted to "know" the answer immediately and preferred not to ask for help except when absolutely stuck.  
In addition, she had a difficult time articulating her purposes in working.  Whether this was due to the fact that she herself did not know her purposes, whether she knew them but could not articulate them, or whether she just felt that they were "private" and did not want to share, is not
entirely clear.  
What is clear, according to the dribble file, is that there were times when she was clearly confused about left and right turns, about the effects of a series of steps in a procedure, or about error messages generated by misunderstandings about LOGO syntax -- and she did not ask for help, or use any other thoughtful strategies for clarifying her confusion.  Laura often evidenced confusion by appearing bored, or by acting in a particularly "perky" manner.  
In describing Laura's experience we will try to identify what we believe she learned solidly, and what she evidenced confusion about. 

Laura showed great interest in making large, freely conceived designs
on the display screen.  She created the designs one stp at a time,
considering thoughtfully the size and placement of each new addition to
her creation.  It was difficult for Laura to make the transition to
formalization of her work; to breaking it down into small tasks, and to
planning and organization.  Consequently, there was often a gap between
what Laura wanted to accomplish, and what she was able to accomplish.
Laura did carry out a few major projects:  a FACE project with several
subprocedures; a series of designs using circles and squares of
variable sizes constructed by means of recursive procedures with
changing inputs (sessions 10-15); a "madlib" language game (sessions
17-19), for which Laura created the basic story, wrote out lists of
nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, and for which the teacher helped
with most of the programming; and causing the computer to draw her
initials (session 25).

Sometimes Laura appeared to be bored.  In hindsight, this appears to
have been a manifestation of confusion, rather than boredom.  Too much
stress was placed on offering her new ideas, rather than understanding
her confusion, and taking steps to help her limit her choices and
consolidate her earlier learning.  Laura's difficulties were compounded
by the fact that she did not like to ask for help, she did not like to
be observed in her work, and she assumed an "air of confidence" at all
times.

At the very first session, Laura showed great interest in names and in "communicating" with the computer.  She noticed "FOO" on the display screen, and asked "Does the computer eat?  It says `FOOD'"  She was also very interested when
she mistakenly typed
"BLT, and the computer responded "YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME HOW TO BLT."  (Much later she was to say "let's teach it how to BLT," and "Gary, remember BLT?"

Throughout her work
Laura had difficulty "driving the TURTLE," distinguishing between left and right, etc.  She is left handed, and often confused left/right.  (In her face project, the eye on the right of the drawing was called LEFTEYE which would have been accurate from the perspective of the face -- looking out from the display screen.)  She also reversed letters in spelling a lot (NOES for "nose", for example.)

At the same time, Laura demonstrated  over and over again, that she did not like to make an analytical effort in her work.  She could copy a "formula" successfully, and even have an idea why it worked, but she had difficulty in adapting it to a new situation, or changing it slightly.  She rarely made a specific plan that she tried to carry through -- preferring to erase a procedure rather than edit it, and to
clear the screen
and start again with a drawing, rather than analyze what was wrong.  She even developed 
a habit of typing POTS (PRINTOUT TITLES), every time she wanted to make any change in what she was doing.  This had the effect of displaying a long string of procedure names on the screen, and totally "wiping out" her previous work.
(Tina created the same effect by typing a string of carriage returns.)

It seemed important for Laura to "give the world the impression" that she
"knew a lot," without making a real intellectual effort to learn.  Along with this 
went the strategy of hiding what she didn't know, and when she did ask for help, only attending to the minimal amount necessary to solve the immediate problem -- i.e. get the procedure to do the right thing -- without concentrating on the underlying principles or debugging strategies.

12. Laura' Work in Turtle Geometry

0During this same first section, Laura had a good deal of difficulty "driving the turtle" -- choosing correct numbers for right, left and forward.  She appeared "bored" with turtle driving activities, and I introduced the idea of writing a random procedure, and repeating it -- an idea that Laura seemed to enjoy and understand -- but that she never tried for herself when working alone. 
When Laura got her first chance to work alone at a graphics terminal.  She worked without advance planning.  
She built an elaborate open ended design, using direct commands quite carefully, to put a rectangle around a circle.  
In the next class, she did another elaborate design involving many instructions, some of which had already disappeared from the screen before the design was complete.  When she attempted to "capture" the design on paper so that she could teach it to the computer, she had already lost some critical steps from the first part of her exploration.

At the beginning of the next session, 
she was asked to plan a simple design by drawing it first on paper, then trying it out, and then trying to teach it to the computer.  Laura decided to make a face, and drew
the following sketch!

.block 18

Carrying out this project was difficult for Laura.  She had not yet written any procedures, and this project needed sub-procedures.  In addition; all her previous designs had been "planned as they went along," with Laura working in "designer mode" -- try this -- then try that.  Now she was trying out a fixed plan -- but she did not understand clearly enough how to manipulate the sizes of the elements -- circles and squares, and how to locate the turtle so that they would be in the correct positions.  She needed a lot of help from me to work through 
this project.

In retrospect,
this project may have been
an interuption of Laura's natural learning path.  The things that she "learned" were not totally absorbed by her at this point.  Laura was also put in the position of "needing help", which continued
until the project was finished.  On the other hand, Laura was very pleased with the result, and did have an opportunity to work much more carefully and critically with TURTLE manipulations.
She learned to write procedures and sub-procedures, and was exposed to the idea of a superprocedure (although she never really used it again on her own!).

When Laura went back to "designing," she used
circles of different sizes.  
Laura's next
procedure, AROUND, a collection of different sized LCIRCLES all starting from the same
point, was not constructed by following a specific pattern -- rather, Laura added the circles in a somewhat random way:  Large, smaller, smaller, smaller, smallest, largest, smaller, smaller, larger...as if she were studying the design and asking "what size circle would look good now?"  Her procedure was copied directly from the screen to her notebook, and from her notebook to the procedure.  She also began numbering steps by 10's.

Next, she made
a symmetrical procedure with RCIRCLEs, and then put them both together.  Following this Laura went back to more free form experimentation in her "designer" mode  -- try this...then see what looks good next.

Session eleven was one of Laura' best days.  She developed a fairly complex -- but not too complex -- design.  She copied the steps in her notebook, 
and then taught the procedure to the computer.  At the teacher's suggestion, Laura made one part of the design a sub-procedure, which simplified the debugging which was later necessary.  Laura had to do a lot of debugging, because she had difficulty copying correctly from her notebook.  She worked a lot with the EDIT and
PRINTOUT (PO) commands, 
comparing the steps as written in her notebook, with the steps as listed in the procedure.  She did not debug by tracing through the procedure directly, to see what each step was doing. 

.block 15
.sp 13

Figure 16.4

Laura' working style seems to have been:  Try something.  If you like it, copy the steps down in your notebook.  Then teach it to the computer copying the steps from your notebook.  Try to be careful not to make a mistake copying.  Although Laura realized that procedures 
could be changed if necessary, she did not see the procedure itself as the thing 
to be experimented with -- trying it out, and then changing it to make it do what 
she wanted.

During later classes
Laura worked a lot with recursion, variables, stop rules, and a long language project -- a "mad lib" game.  She did not return to "designer mode" until
one of the last classes,
when she picked up on one of her first project ideas -- making her initials.

It is clear from her dribble files that Laura worked on her initials by a process
of trial and error -- then wrote down the correct steps in her notebook.  She did not plan ahead or try to think about the easiest way to do it.  As a result, she wound up having procedures with many more steps than necessary, as she retraced her course in finishing her letter.  Her E, made of just four straight lines, had 15 steps.  
She reverted to incrementing line numbers by ones after reaching 100:  
10, 20, ....100, 101, 102, ...107.)
In addition, she had bugs resulting from
mis-copying steps into and out of her notebook.  
The teacher suggested stepping through the procedure after printing it out and checking it against her notebook.  
Laura did not have the idea of stepping through the procedure on her own, (or didn't think she could do it without help, or didn't want to bother doing it without help.)

When Laura worked on her B (her last initial), she ran into exactly the same problems:  little or no planning; poor copying to and from notebook; line numbers increase by ones above 100; confusion about which way to turn the TURTLE,
LEFT 90 or RIGHT 90; and especially no clear sense of how to debug by stepping through a procedure (playing computer), although
this technique had been emphasized with her for five classes in a row.

Laura missed two of the last four classes (she was absent for one, and went on a class trip for another) and never completed her initials -- although
she could probably have finished them, and created a superprocedure to draw all three, in about one more session.  Laura also did not bring a visitor to class at the next-to-last session, when the children were given an opportunity to do so.

13. Laura's Work With Recursion and Variables

0During classes 12-16, Laura was introduced several new ideas:
recursion; procedures with inputs; recursion with fixed inputs and recursion with varying 
inputs.  Later
she worked on a long language project - creating a kind of "madlib" game, and then
returned to do
some more work with variables -- recursive procedures with two inputs.

In session 12 both recursion, and the use of variables were introduced
to Laura.  She was shown her a procedure:  

.indent 6
.nofill
.block 4
TO TWIST
10 LCIRCLE 40
20 RIGHT 30
50 TWIST

.indent 0
.adjust
She then wanted to make TWISTs of different sizes and was shown how to make the size of the circle a variable.  She wrote: 

.indent 6
.nofill
.block 4
TO TWIST2: SIZE
10 LCIRCLE :SIZE
20 RIGHT 90
30 TWIST2:SIZE

.indent 0
.adjust
She seemed to understand what she was doing.  Although she had introduced the 
RIGHT 90 in line 20, she seemed surprised that the shape of her circle design was
different from the preceeding one.  She understood that she could
vary the size of the design by varying the input to TWIST2.

In the next session (13) Laura continued to write procedures with a variable SIZE.  She began to show some
more confusions.  She usually left the :SIZE out of the procedure title.  She tried to use 
EDT (EDIT TITLE), but used it incorrectly and disregarded error messages.  She wrote a procedure called TO SQUARE: SIZE, which did not use a variable :SIZE within the procedure.  And, when copying from me, the procedure TO SQ:SIZE, she made all the forward steps 
FORWARD 66:SIZE, not understanding that :SIZE replaced the specific forward step.  
Once she had the SQ :SIZE procedure defined correctly, she was able to
make a very exciting design using SQ 1, SQ 2, ...SQ 82. 
 
.block 21
.sp 19
.ce
Figure 13.5

To capitalize on this discovery, 
the following procedure was shown to Laura at the next class (14): 

.nofill
.block 4
TO GROWSQ :SIZE
10 SQ :SIZE
20 GROWSQ :SIZE+1
END

.adjust
However, when Laura tried to copy this, she typed: 

.nofill
.block 4
TO GROW SQ :SIZE
10 SQ :SIZE
20 GROW SQ :SIZE
END

.adjust
She forgot to type in the +1, despite a very careful explanation by
the teacher of how the procedure worked.  Also, since she 
left a space between GROW and SQ:SIZE, she kept getting error messages when she tried to use the procedure.  She did read the error messages, and tried several ways of typing the procedure, to try to eliminate the error. She tried GROW SQ, GROW SQ 1, GROWSQ 1, GROW SQ 1 100, GROW 1 100, none of which worked.  Finally she asked for help, and
the teacher suggested she erase the procedure GROW and copy it over, making GROWSQ one word.  
She had beens resourceful in trying different ways of typing the procedure names, but she did not look at the procedure itself to see what was wrong.  Another example of Laura' basic working style; lots of trial and error -- no analysis!

Later in the same period, Laura was trying TWIST 80, TWIST 40, TWIST 300.  All of these produced the same figure, since TWIST was a fixed instruction procedure.  When Laura finally asked for help,
she was asked to print out the procedure and look at it
to see why it always made the same shape.  Once again, Laura had tried different things, but had not looked at the procedure to see what was wrong.  Still later in the
same class period, she was making a procedure to draw a letter T for a friend, whose name was Tina.  She made two attempts TINA, and TINA1, neither of which worked.  In neither case did she look at the procedure and try to analyze it.

The next session was a
group lesson about debugging, the use of PO (PRINTOUT) and step by step analysis of a procedure.  Laura spent the period playing around with old procedures, trying to copy other kids procedures from the bulletin board -- without copying the subprocedures needed, and in general wasting time.
This was interpreted by the teacher
as "boredom" and
he suggested
a new project.  
Laura agreed to try something new, but in her notebook that day she wrote "By the way, I am not board"(sic).  
She may have been confused about what had happened when she tried to use variables
-- and what she needed was probably more simple projects using variables in 
procedures and subprocedures.  Laura had been given more 
ideas than she could absorb in classes 12-14, and this was the message she was giving me -- not boredom.

Instead of giving Laura an opportunity to explore
things she already knew, and to consolidate what she was learning about variables.
She was launched  into a new project:  writing a program to produce "Madlibs".  This was a learning experience for her.  She had to clarify her ideas about nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs and how they are used in English -- as well as to make up a simple story, and choose lists of words that would make the story funny.  On the other hand, it presented her with a whole new set of things to be confused about, as well as requiring a lot of precise typing.  Although Laura was able to understand the language aspects of the procedure, it is unclear what she understood about the programming required, which involved the use of OUTPUT, MAKE and a bit of list processing.  Laura was pleased when the project was completed -- but she hadn't been able to do much of the programming or understand how the procedures worked.

If Laura was to continue as a LOGO student, we would reconsider our
teaching strategy as follows:

.twinch 4.5
--encourage her to continue explorations with TURTLE commands.  She still
had a lot to resolve in the areas of left/right discrimination, analyzing sequences of steps to see their effect, and attention to detail in copying.

--stress planning of simple projects like initials, encouraging more use of subprocedures.

--go back to simple applications of variables, again with stress on planning -- what is supposed to change?  where does it belong in the procedure?  what name is chosen for the variable? etc.  Then there would be examples of the use of procedures with variables as subprocedures, in both recursive and non-recursive situations.  
Laura was close to understanding these points -- but got presented with too much, too soon.

--One area which Laura did not really get into, which might excxite her as a designer, is repetition of a random set of commands.

--It might be useful to experiment with the use of an automatic drawing procedure like DRAW, so that Laura could experience success with some of her more elaborate designs.

.indent 0
Given Laura' avoidance of "cognitive risk"; her reluctance to reveal her confusions; and her desire to appear to "know" everything instantly, she would always be a difficult child to teach.  On the other hand, situations with more stress on ways she could plan and predict outcomes, and fewer sources of confusion introduced from outside, could probably
help Laura assimilate some of the problem solving skills which she avoided.
