5.1 Dennis' Working Style

0Dennis is a bright, articulate student who makes connections easily,
and has a strong desire to continually expand his knowledge.  He began
by being very excited about using the computer, asking a lot of
questions about what the computer could do, and how to accomplish
different things.  
Dennis had a lot of difficulty setting into a particular project.
Although he quickly progressed through a number of
LOGO activities, he seemed to have difficulty with syntax --
remembering how to WRITE his file, or use a PRINT statement, or
incorporate variables into his work.

Dennis seemed to understand a concept rather quickly, but to have
difficulty with the details involved in using the concept.  He liked to
keep all his work "in his head," and only gradually accepted the
idea of taking notes that might help him carry on his work. Notes, once
taken, were often left lying around the room.  Having worked out
a series of steps to draw a particular figure on the screen, he seemed
to have difficulty concentrating on the task of accurately translating
those steps into a LOGO procedure.

Dennis eagerly sought new information and asked questions about new
ideas.  On the other hand, he did not like to ask for help when he
encountered difficulties in his work -- and often rejected "helpful
suggestions," when they were offered.
He seemed to prefer his own independent, ideosyncratic ways of doing things, to
learning more efficient ways from another person.  When he was asked,
in a pre-LOGO interview, "If you're stuck on something in school, what
kinds of things do you do?"  Dennis answered:  "I try to control myself
to work harder on it, and if worse comes to worse (sic) I just sit in
the corner and sulk.  I just try to deal with it."  This approach to
situations in which he was "stuck" was quite characteristic of his work
in the LOGO classes.

One of the areas in which Dennis often had difficulty was in taking a
series of successful steps already worked out on the screen, and translating
them into a LOGO procedure.  He persisted for a long time in numbering
steps by ones, despite the fact that he understood quite well the
justification for numbering steps by fives or tens.  Since he often
made mistakes copying steps, he often had to make laborious
changes in his procedures.  To compensate for the problem of forgetting
line numbers, Dennis usually put many steps on one line.  He
persisted in using this technique despite numerous errors which
required that he re-type long lines of commands.  It was more important
for Dennis to use his method (numbering by ones, and putting many
steps on a line) than it was for him to have a method that made
debugging easier (numbering by tens, putting one command on each line,
and carefully keeping track of the line number).

It seemed as though Dennis expected that bugs would not occur -- even
though he continued to make small errors throughout his LOGO classes --
and that he did not have to work in a way that made debugging
easier.  The irony was that he understood the advantages, of the
suggested methods, but persisted in using his own, even though they
were less successful, and caused him more problems later.  "It's my
funeral," he once remarked in such a situation.

It is sriking to see a bright child persist in strategies known to be
unsuccessful, when alternative strategies are available.

Dennis seemed to be at loose ends during the first few weeks of
computer classes.  He explored a lot of different ideas, without
settling in to work in one particular area, or committing himself to a
project.  Finally, after a great deal of coaxing, he agreed to work on
a project which the teacher suggested 
-- a moving car with spinning wheels.  He
worked on this project for eight classes.  Although he had a lot of
difficulty carrying it out (see below), and was  frustrated at
several points, he maintained a strong commitment to the project until
it was completed.

Work in Turtle Geometry

15.2  Dennis' Work in Turtle Geometry With Triangles and Variables

0Dennis' work in Turtle Geometry was characterized by an excellent
understanding of the use of LOGO to create designs, by a good ability
to estimate distance, and a lot of problems with orientation and
estimating angles.

Dennis worked on a series of short projects involving triangles.
He started with drawing a triangle, and continued to make an equilateral
triangle, variable sized triangles, designs using triangles, and a
design consiting of nested triangles.  This work occupied five
different sessions mostly during the early classes, but including one
class near the end.

He constructed his first triangle using a trial and
error approach.  For his first attempt at drawing an equilateral triangle
he used rotations of 128 and 110 degrees at the corners.
When he copied his steps to make a procedure, TRI, he
made an arithmetical error in combining angles, and wound up with the
shape shown in figure 5.1.

.block 13

4 BACK 99
5 LEFT 140
6 RIGHT 70
7 FORWARD 99
END

.ce
Figure 5.1

Although Dennis realized that this was not what he expected, 
he drew
on previous experience in making a recursive design 
to create the patterned procedure ULTRATRI:

.nofill
.indent 6
.block 5
TO ULTRATRI
1 TRI

.adjust

Returning to constructing a triangle, Dennis abandoned equal lengths,
and produced a close approximation to a triangle.  He called his
procedure THRI (to distinguish it from TRI).

3 RT 130
4 FD 110

END

.ce
Figure 5.2
.indent 0

.adjust
At a subsequent class, Dennis asked how to make a triangle of variable
size, so that he could make a design of nested triangles.  
The teacher explained that it would be
simpler to use variables neatly if he could make an equilateral
triangle, and that an equilateral triangle had equal
angles at each point.  With this information, Dennis
was able to find the correct angle, 120 degrees, in five or six tries.
Dennis called his new procedure THRI1, and his variable, "S3.

.nofill
.indent 6
.block 11

1 FD :S3

3 FD :S3
4 RT 120
5 FD :S3
6 RT 120
END

.ce
Figure 5.3

.adjust
.indent 0
Next, Dennis began to make a set of nested triangles using
the variable-sized triangle he had already
created.
He wanted to make a
design that looked like this:

.block 11 
.sp 9
.ce
Figure 5.4

While making it, he had a lot of trouble with the state of the
TURTLE: orientation of the TURTLE before and after making the triangle;
re-orientation of the TURTLE to move it vertically before making the next
triangle; whether the pen was up or down, etc.  After struggling
through several repetitions, he wanted to give up.

In the next class, he was reminded that he could make a procedure to
repeat the group of steps that kept recurring, and he defined these procedures:

.nofill
.indent 4
.block 10
TO SECT:SIZE	and	TO HAL :SIZE
1 LEFT 90		10 SECT :SIZE
2 THRI1:SIZE		20 HAL :SIZE

4 PENUP
5 BACK 30	and	TO H1 :SIZE
6 PENDOWN		10 SECT :SIZE
END			20 RIGHT 50
			30 H1 :SIZE
			END

.epage 1
.indent 0
.adjust
He was content to leave these procedures as they were without varying the size, 
but enjoyed the effects of a variety of inputs.

.block 30
.sp 28
.ce
Figure 5.5

At a later point, Dennis came back to his variable triangle procedure,
and followed through with his original intention of making a set of
nested triangles.  At that point he had a clearer idea of how to make
use of variables, and a good strategy for solving the nested triangle
problem.  He realized that if he could solve the problem of nesting a
second triangle at the proper position inside the first triangle, that
the complete nested design could be drawn by repeating the same process
over and over.

.block 11
.sp 9
.ce
Figure 5.6

Dennis realized that the essence of the process was to draw one
triangle, move the TURTLE forward half the length of the triangle, and
rotate the TURTLE, before repeating the same process with a second
triangle, half the size of the first.

.block 16
.sp 14
.ce
Figure 5.7

He had a problem determining how far to rotate the TURTLE before
drawing the second triangle.  Resolution of this problem required a
great deal of trial and error with careful attention to detail. 
After about ten tries he was ready to settle on a rotation of 55
degrees, as the correct amount to rotate the TURTLE.  When he looked
carefully at the resulting figure, he was able to see that the
two triangles were slightly out of alignment.  His next attempt, 60
degrees, was the correct rotation to produce the effect he was seeking.

At this point he was able to talk through the necessary steps.

.nofill
.block 3
"THRI1 :SIZE
move forward half of :SIZE
turn RIGHT 60 degrees,
repeat the whole process with a value of one half of :SIZE."

His procedure became:
 
.nofill
.indent 6
.block 6
TO Q :SIZE
10 THRI1 :SIZE
20 FD :SIZE/2
30 RT 60
40 Q :SIZE/2
END

.indent 0
.adjust
Dennis wanted to make Q stop, "when :SIZE is less than 10."  After some
additional conversation about the location of the stop rule in the
procedure, he added line 35 to Q:

35 IF :SIZE < 10 STOP

which had the desired effect.

Some things to notice about Dennis' work with triangles and variables:
he consistently had difficulty with problems of TURTLE orientation,
as in making his HAL figure or in nesting the smaller triangle inside
the larger one.  He had no difficulty with the idea of variables --
which he related to something he was familiar with from math class.  But he
had difficulty with the syntax of using variables -- where to put the
dots, in both the commands and in the procedure titles.  He seemed to
understand the way in which his procedures functioned, and was able to
see how his descriptions of what he wanted to do translated into LOGO.
He never did carry through a project with variables entirely on his own.

.he2
CAR Project
15.3  Dennis' CAR Project

0In class thirteen, the teacher insisted that
Dennis commit himself to a long
term project.  He chose to draw a moving car, with spinning wheels.  Once
committed to the project, he followed through on it for eight classes
-- despite a good deal of frustration with the details.  

.block 27
.sp 25
.ce
Figure 5.8

Rather than describe Dennis' work on this project sequentially, we
differentiate between those
aspects of the work that were easy for him, and
those that were  difficult.  We offer some speculation about why so
much of this project, which would have been simple and
straightforward for a student like Jimmy was so difficult for Dennis.

Most of Dennis' problems seemed to be in the area of "work habits" and
attention to detail.  Lack of attention to detail, combined with
left-right orientation problems, meant that a lot of Dennis'
difficulties showed up as TURTLE state bugs.

On the other hand, Dennis rather easily understood the important
"concepts" of the project:  how to use positive and negative inputs to
the SPIN command, together with a centered circle procedure, to make a
wheel that spins around its own center; how to use MOVET to move the
car; how to use 45 and 60 degree angles to make the fenders and body of
his car; and how to use symmetry to make his front window a "reversed"
version of his rear one.  During the course of the project he learned
to make use of separate subprocedures for each part of his design, and
began to number the steps in his procedures by fives.

In illustration of both the strengths and weaknesses of Dennis' work on this
project, consider the process by which Dennis made the windows
for his car, which took three class periods to complete.

At the end of class #15, Dennis had completed a series of procedures
that drew the basic outline of the car as shown in figure 5.9.  He
wanted the rear window located parallel to the body of the car.

.block 20
.sp 18
.ce
Figure 5.9

Two suggestions were made to help him get started. First,  that he
draw the window by itself on an empty screen first, and add it to the
car as a separate procedure later; second, that he look at the
BODY procedure, to find the angle to use for the windows.

Looking at the BODY procedure, Dennis quickly noticed that the correct
angle was 60 degrees.  He then cleared the screen and easily drew a
window, starting with the TURTLE in the upright position:

.nofill
.indent 6
.block 14
TO WIN1
1 RT 30 FD 60 RT 60 FD 20 RT 90 FD 50
2 RT 90 FD 50
END
.INDENT 0
.sp 7
.ce
Figure 5.10

.adjust
With the TURTLE in the vertical position, Dennis had no difficulty
turning it right 30 degrees, going forward and then turning it 60
degrees to make it horizontal.  It seemed as though he made use of the
fact that 30 and 60 add up to a full 90 degrees in deciding to use 60 for the
second turn, although this was never stated.
The distance estimates
were also fairly easy for him to make.  The WIN1 procedure left the TURTLE
facing horizontally to the left.

When Dennis attempted to place the window in the
car, however, he did not realize that he
had to orient the TURTLE vertically before using his WIN1 procedure.
As a result, the window kept coming
out in the wrong position and Dennis became very confused.  

When he came back to working on the window, he was
reminded
that to orient his window properly he had to begin with the TURTLE
in an upright position.  
He had 
decided to add another
feature to the car, before drawing the window.  
A curved
antenna was added, completing the body, so that the turtle, now in
position A, needed to move to position B (shown in figure 5.11).

.block 11
.sp 9
.ce
Figure 5.11

After experimentation, estimation of distances, etc., Dennis wrote the
following procedure:

TO WIP (window in place)
.br
.NOFILL
1 MO HUBS BUM BODY ANT PENUP RIGHT 180 FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90 FORWARD
   80 RIGHT 180 RIGHT 20 FORWARD 10 PENDOWN
2 WIN1
END

.adjust
This procedure accurately placed the turtle in an upright position
before drawing the window.  The' subprocedure MO moved the car
over, so that the entire picture fit on the screen.  The other
subprocedures drew parts of the car.  In typing the steps Dennis originally left
out two commands:  ANT and PENDOWN.  He had to retype the entire procedure
twice to replace them.  He placed all the steps on one line despite
several discussions explaining how numbering steps by 10s and placing
each step on a different line would make further corrections and debugging easier.

At the end of the period Dennis forgot to save the procedure on his disk
by writing a file!  He had to repeat the whole process again next
time -- including the exploration, since he had kept no notes.  This
time, he came out with a slightly different location for the TURTLE --
one which left the TURTLE tilted 1 degree from the vertical.
.nofill

.BLOCK 4
TO WIP
10 MO HUBS BUM BODY ANT
20 RIGHT 180 PENUP FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90 FORWARD 60 FORWARD 10 RIGHT 70
   RIGHT 180 LEFT 45 BACK 5 LEFT 6 PENDOWN
30 PENDOWN WIN1
END
.adjust

Dennis' final version of WIP shows some improvement
over what he had previously done.  The lines are numbered by tens.
Each line of WIP has a distinct purpose.  Line 10 draws all the
previous parts of the car; line 20 moves the TURTLE over to draw the
window; line 30 draws the window.

He had no problem figuring out how to draw the middle window as a square:

.nofill
.block 3
TO WIN2
10 PENUP BACK 100 RIGHT 90 PENDOWN FORWARD 55 RIGHT 90
  FORWARD 55 RIGHT 90 FORWARD 55 RIGHT 90 FORWARD 55
END

.adjust
He originally made WIN2 draw a square with sides of 43.  When he
decided to change to a size of 55, he had to retype all of line 10.

Before Dennis began to draw WIN3, The teacher suggested that he make
use of symmetry by using the WIN1
procedure as a model, and draw the new window by reversing the turns in
WIN1, while keeping all the distances the same.  Dennis understood this
approach and decided to use it.  
Once again he forgot that the
TURTLE had to be vertical before carrying out this aspect
of the project.  Finally he recovered after being reminded to set the
TURTLE heading up before reversing the steps of WIN1.  Finally Dennis
produced the procedure WIN3:

.nofill
.block 3
TO WIN3
10 PENUP BACK 145 PENDOWN RIGHT 90 LEFT 30 FORWARD 60 LEFT 60
   FORWARD 20 LEFT 90 FORWARD 50 LEFT 90 FORWARD 50
END

.adjust
Once again, Dennis left out PENDOWN in copying the steps, and had to redo the
whole line.  
The underlined steps are the steps of WIN1
reversed, although they are not set off as a separate sub-procedure, or
even accorded a line of their own in WIN3.

Throughout this process Dennis was constantly frustrated by his failure
to remember where the TURTLE had to be heading at the start of a
procedure like WIN1; by his failure to take useful notes -- leading to
the omission of steps like PENDOWN; and by his method of including as many
steps as possible on one line -- necessitating the retyping of an
entire line, everytime he made a typing error or omission.  Although
all these problems were pointed out to him by the teacher, along with
suggestions for how to alleviate them, Dennis seemed to prefer to
struggle along with his own methods rather than to `bother' to take
notes or put each step on its own line in a procedure.

An Interesting Parallel
.block 5
15.4  A Parallel Between Two Projects, and a Question0

An interesting parallel may be observed
between details that occured in each of two projects described:
making the window for his car, and drawing the nested triangles.

In drawing the window Dennis started with the TURTLE in
an upright position.  He turned it RIGHT 30, then moved FORWARD 60 and then
turned the TURTLE RIGHT 60, to make the top of the window.  All this was done without
any explanation -- following a discussion in which Dennis decided to
make the window slant at an angle of 60 degrees, to parallel the BODY
of his CAR (see figure 5.12a).

A similar situation occurred when he was making the nested equilateral
triangles.
The first triangle started in an upright
position.  After completing one triangle, Dennis moved the turtle
forward half of its length, and once again, had to turn the turtle
right 60 degrees.  In this case, he did not "know" that the angle to
turn was 60 degrees, and had to establish it 
by means of a trial and error process
of successive approximations.  (see figure 5.12b).

The question is -- why was Dennis not able to make use of the
knowledge he had about 60 degree angles in drawing the nested
triangles, when he was able to use it in drawing the car window?
Possibly he used the fact that 30 + 60 = 90, when drawing the window.
It is interesting to conjecture that he might have
been able to find the correct angle without experimentation if the
first triangle had been oriented at an angle of 30 degrees to the
vertical to start with (see figure 5.12c).

Work with Dynaturtle
.block 3
15.5. Dennis' work With Dynaturtle0

Dennis' work with Dynaturtle gave an opportunity for him to discover
new strategies to solve problems in another domain.  The Dynaturtle is
a simulated "Newtonian turtle" which follows Newtonian laws of motion,
rather than regular TURTLE commands (see Part II, Chapter 6).   The 
motion of the dynaturtle can
be changed only by giving it a "kick" (impulse) in a given direction.
Dennis was given two games to use with the dynaturtle: GAME1 required
him to land the dynaturtle on a fixed target; LUNER required him to move a
"falling" dynaturtle so that it landed on a specified "landing pad",
rather than "crash" on the moon.  (See Part II, Chapter 6 of this
report for more information about dynaturtle activities.) 

Dennis worked on dynaturtle activities for all or part of three
different classes.  He gradually began to show a lot more interest in
the messages printed by the different game programs than in playing the
games themselves.  (See section 5.6, below.)  Dennis' work with the
LUNER game was characteristic of his approach to dynamics.  The LUNER
game begins with the turtle situated above, and to the left of a
platform on which it must land for a successful outcome.  The initial
orientation of the turtle is straight up -- as shown in fig. 5.13.  If
the dynaturtle is not kicked, it will "fall" straight down and "crash".
(The LUNER program gives the dynaturtle a steady downward "gravitational "kick."

.block 12
.sp 10
.ce
Figure 5.13

One fairly simple strategy for the game would be to quickly turn the
dynaturtle until it was facing horizontally to the right, then give it three
or four kicks.  The combination of rightward velocity and continuing
downward acceleration would be likely to land it on the pad --
depending on the timing and number of the rightward kicks.

Dennis quickly realized that if left alone, the dynaturtle would fall to the
bottom of the screen and crash.  He discovered that he could counteract
this by kicking the dynaturtle straight up, temporarily counteracting the
gravitational effect, and giving the dynaturtle an upward velocity.
Most of the time he gave the dynaturtle so many upward
kicks that it would rapidly rise off the screen (wrapping around and
coming onto the screen again from the bottom.)  By the time he
started to turn the dynaturtle to the right, it was so far above the
landing pad that a slight rightward motion would cause it to crash far
to the right of the pad.

During his first two days of working with LUNER, Dennis and Harriet worked
together.  She had adopted a strategy of turning the dynaturtle so
that it was aimed at the landing pad, then kicking several times.
This usually had the desired effect of landing in the right place,
although at unneccessarily high speed.  Although Dennis watched Harriet
at work he did not adopt her strategy when she was present.  When he
worked alone, however, he did adopt a version of
Harriet's method and was able to be reasonably successful with the LUNER
game.

Throughout his work with dynaturtle, it was not unusual for Dennis to
type the K, R, and L keys very rapidly (kick, right and left), without
looking at the effects of any of his actions before  typing
new instructions.

Interactive Programming
.block 4
15.6  Dennis' Work with Printing, Messages and the Beginnings of 
Interactive Programming0

Dennis showed a lot of interest in using the computer in an
"interactive" fashion.  Although he did not undertake a major
interactive project, his continued interest indicated this as a possible future
direction for him.  From time to time, in the early stages, he asked
about uses of the computer other than Turtle Geometry, and was shown a
little bit about how to use PRINT, arithmetic commands, and simple list
processing.  He limited his initial work with PRINT to making a design
of a face.

.epage 1
Dennis devoted one entire class to using the computer as a typewriter/editor for
a story he was writing about Julius Caesar.  He did this by writing a
procedure with 53 lines, each of which printed a sentence.  
In the course of this task, which took about two hours, Dennis
also mastered the use of Control keys for editing.  

While he was working with dynaturtle, Dennis became interested in the
messages printed by the computer at the end of the game.  These
messages told the player whether the landing had been soft, rough or a
crash, depending on the dynaturtle's speed at the moment of impact.  He
complained that these messages were "dumb", and the teacher suggested that he
change them.  He stepped through the LUNER procedure, and
all its subprocedures, until he found the subprocedure FINISH, which
printed the messages.  Dennis spent almost all of one period creating his
own rather elaborate version of these messages:

.nofill
.block 11

COM'ON NOW KLUTZO TRY AGIAN HA!HA!HA!HAAAAA!!! HEH HEH HEE HO!!!!
!!HEH HEH HEH HEH !!!!] PRSPEED STOP

.adjust
0Throughout his work on thse messages, Dennis appeared to be more deeply
involved with his work than he did on Turtle Geometry projects.  He
laughed, talked to himself cheerfully, and thought carefully about each
word.  We may also speculate that the wording he chose for the
messages indicate a lack of self-confidence in his own abilities,
combined with a strong belief that he should be more successful
than he is.

One interesting consequence of Dennis' work on messages for the LUNER
game was that he became much more interested in landing the dynaturtle
on the landing pad, since this was required to activate the messages.
He became quite successful at the LUNER game from this point on.

By the time the classes ended, Dennis was ready to tackle a large interactive
project.
He may do so if he has a
further opportunity to use a computer. 

As his last activity, on the last day of classes, Dennis left a message
for the MIT LOGO Group, in his procedure WERTS:
