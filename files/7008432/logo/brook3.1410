1Turtle Geometry:  What the Students Learned

.indent 3
2The ways in which students control the movements of the LOGO 
TURTLE is an important aspect of their behavior in the LOGO learning
environment.  
In this section, we shall describe the range of student behaviors in
the "learning environment" of "Turtle Geometry", and relate these
behaviors to fundamental understandings in mathematics.

We have organized our observations into six general categories:

.adjust
.indent 6
1. Qualitative structuring of the number worlds.

2. Quantitative structuring of the number worlds.

3. The "group properties" of the number worlds -- the structuring
of mathematical operations.

4  The use of "TURTLE Coordinates" -- the beginnings of
differential geometry. 

5. The use of coordinate systems -- the "global structure" of the
geometric world.

6. Theorems and heuristics -- movement towards formal mathematics.

11. Qualitative Structuring of the "Number World"

.indent 3
2The use of numbers as inputs to TURTLE commands
forces a student to recognize the different roles for
numbers within Turtle Geometry, as well as the different properties of
numbers within each role.  The primary distinction that a student has
to make is between the use of numbers as inputs to FORWARD and as
inputs to RIGHT and LEFT.  For example, in producing figures, the input
to FORWARD determines the size of the figure, while the input to
RIGHT determines the shape.  As an input to FORWARD, a bigger
number produces a "bigger" effect, while as an input to RIGHT, a bigger
number usually produces a "different", but not necessarily "bigger" effect.
RIGHT 180 reverses the TURTLE's direction, while RIGHT 360 causes no
rotation at all for the LOGO screen TURTLE!

Loosely speaking, inputs to FORWARD are mainly "quantitative," while
inputs to RIGHT are largely "qualitative."  FORWARD is conceptually a
"continuous function", while RIGHT is conceptually a "discontinuous
function:" FORWARD 90 and FORWARD 91 produce "almost the same effect,"
while RIGHT 90 and RIGHT 91 can produce extremely different effects in
some circumstances.  

These discontinuities become apparent when a sequence of instructions
is repeated a number of times.  It is the effect of a repeated
difference in rotation that is "discontinuous" even when two single
rotations appear to be very close.  Compare two squares made by the commands

2No matter how often these commands are repeated, the results will be
similar squares of slightly different sizes.  In contrast, consider the effect
of a small change in the angle.  Compare two figures drawn by the commands

2The figure on the right is "almost the same" as the one on the left.
If, however, we repeat both FORWARD 90 RIGHT 90 and FORWARD 90 RIGHT
93 a few more times, the differences become more apparent:

2When the command POLY (with two inputs) is given, it will continue to
repeat a fixed FORWARD-RIGHT combination, until the computer runs out
of storage space.  The first input determines the amount the turtle
will move forward each time; the second determines how much it will
turn.  Varying the second (angle) input, while holding the first
constant, produces dramatically different shapes:

2One of the learner's earliest challenges in the control of the LOGO
TURTLE is to comprehend and make use of this qualitative difference in
the effects of numbers as inputs to TURTLE commands.  (Other roles of
numbers in the LOGO environment have to do with the use of line numbers
to order a sequence of steps in a LOGO procedure, and the use of
numbers as counters in determining how often a series of steps will be
repeated.

.BLOCK 6
1 BEHAVIORS OBSERVED:

11.1 Inputs Chosen by Non Geometric Considerations

0Numbers used as inputs to both FORWARD and RIGHT commands have
no apparent geometric regularity.  They may be determined by
non-geometric considerations such as ease of typing, or previously
familiar number patterns.  At this stage of comprehension, interesting
effects may be produced, but in an uncontrolled way, subject to
unexpected "disasters" such as "OUT OF BOUNDS" messages.

11.2 More Systematic Choices of Inputs
 
The student's choice of input numbers becomes more
systematic, but s/he still does not differentiate between FORWARD/BACK
and RIGHT/LEFT commands.

1Examples:

1.2.1 0One simple regularity consists of reducing all inputs to
relatively small numbers (say under 100) in hopes of avoiding "OUT OF
BOUNDS" messages.

11.2.20 Another undifferentiated regularity consists of using
multiples of ten as inputs, apparently reflecting the observation by
the student that small changes in inputs to FORWARD (and to RIGHT and
LEFT in cases where polygons are not involved) produce very small
effects.  At this stage some students repeatedly use a few key
"round numbers;"e.g.,  30, 50, 90 or 100, for inputs to all turtle commands.

.block 5
11.3 Differentiation Between Linear and Angular Inputs

0The student differentiates between linear and angular uses of
numbers.  Typically this involves at first the discovery that certain
"special angles" produce uniquely desirable effects.  Eventually the student 
clearly differentiates between the two by dropping the
use of the "special angle" numbers: 90, 120, 180, etc. as inputs to
FORWARD (except in certain isolated particular instances).  Some students
develop a less significant set of "special inputs to FORWARD":
100, 200, etc.  that are not usually used as inputs to RIGHT and LEFT.
 
1EXAMPLES:

1.3.1 0The student discovers the significance of 90 degrees as an
input to RIGHT and LEFT commands.  A typical student project is the
construction of a square or rectangle, using 90 degree rotations.  (At
this point some students still show a blurred differentiation between
linear and angular inputs.  Many students draw their first squares by
typing FORWARD 90, RIGHT 90, FORWARD 90, ...)

TURTLE's direction.

11.3.4 0The student finds rotations that produce simple closed
shapes when repeatedly rotating a figure.  Repeating RCIRCLE, RIGHT 60,
for example, produces a shape that closes after six repetitions;
RCIRCLE, RIGHT 45 closes after eight repetitions.

degrees), etc.

Quantitative Structuring of Numbers
.page
12. Quantitative Structuring of the "Number Worlds"

.indent 3
2Many students begin LOGO with a very poor ability to estimate the
relative effect of numbers.  Splitting the "world of numbers" into
"length numbers" and "angle numbers" provides a qualitative
structure for that world.  Estimating the practical effects of
particular numbers provides a quantitative structure.  We have
observed that most students find it easier to make estimates involving
linear numbers than estimates involving angular numbers.  The same
holds true for other operations with these numbers, to be discussed in
section 4 below.  This may be due both to a greater ease of visual
comparison of linear magnitudes and to the discontinuous effects of
angular numbers, discussed in section 2 above.

.indent 0
.block 5
1BEHAVIORS OBSERVED:

2.1 Becoming Aware of Limiting Factors

0 A student's first quantiative structuring of numbers often occurs
when he or she becomes aware of certain limiting factors and
realizes that certain numbers are too small or too large to be of
practical effect in most applications.

.BLOCK 5
1EXAMPLES:

2.1.1 Lack of Appreciation of "Orders of Magnitude"

0The student discovers that very small inputs to FORWARD/BACK
and RIGHT/LEFT produce negligible effects, and shifts to inputs larger
than 10 for most FORWARD and RIGHT commands.  For a student who has
little sense of relative magnitude of numbers, this step may be far
from obvious, and may require a great deal of experimentation.  Deborah's
first LOGO command was FORWARD 10.  When she
realized that the effect was so tiny as to be almost invisible, her
friends urged her to "try a larger number".  She responded by typing
FORWARD 12.  At this point she had no sense how much larger a number
had to be to produce an appreciably different effect.  (We have found
this type of behavior to be more generally prevalent when much younger
children (ages 6-9) are introduced to LOGO.)

.he2
Finding the Limits
.block 5
12.1.2  Coping with "OUT OF BOUNDS" errors

0 The student discovers that large inputs to FORWARD and
BACK may result in "OUT OF BOUNDS" error messages. S/he attempts to
predict how large a number can be used as an input without producing an
"OUT OF BOUNDS" message.  Eventually s/he is able to create designs
that remain "in bounds" by limiting the size of inputs to FORWARD
commands to numbers less than 100 or 200.

.block 5
12.1.3  The Largest Possible Inputs to LOGO Commands

0The student discovers upper limits to RIGHT/LEFT and SPIN
comands.  In this case, the limits do not correspond to physically
observable criteria such as a distance on the display screen, but are
based on "arbitrary" limits imposed by the designers of the computer
language.  Students often find these limits by a process of trial and error. 

.block 5
12.1.4  Finding that 360o is the Largest Meaningful Rotation

0The student discovers that inputs to RIGHT and LEFT turn
the TURTLE more than once around.  This is a relatively early discovery
for students using a "floor TURTLE" as it can be clearly observed that
a rotation larger than 360 degrees turns the TURTLE more than once
around.  It is more difficult to discover with the "screen TURTLE,"
because the TURTLE moves instantaneously to its new position without
visibly rotating.

.he2
Estimating Distances
.block 5
12.2  Estimating Distances

0The student develops strategies for estimating the number of
TURTLE steps needed to move the turtle to a particular point on the screen.
The estimate can be refined by an approach involving successive approximations.

.block 6
1EXAMPLES:

2.2.1 Predicting Large Scale Effects.

0A student begins to be able to predict with some degree of
accuracy the effect of particular inputs to FORWARD such as FORWARD 50
or FORWARD 100.

.block 5
12.2.2  Finding Precise Distances by Successive Approximations

0A student moves the turtle to a particular location, by
using a trial and error approach.  For example, Kevin
constructed a right isoceles triangle, each of whose equal sides was
100 turtle steps.  To complete the hypotenuse, he used the
following sequence of commands:  FORWARD 100 (too small), FORWARD 50
(too big), BACK 5 (still to big) and BACK 5 (seemed just right).

.SPREAD
/Figure 2.1//Figure 2.2 

.sp 8

.spread
/Figure 2.3//Figure 2.4

A student may also use a method of successive approximations to
find the distance from the center, to the edge of the screen.  The
following sequence of commands is a typical one.  Starting with the
TURTLE in the center of the screen, a student might type:  

.nofill
.block 10
?FORWARD 150
?FORWARD 100
OUT OF BOUNDS
?FORWARD 50
?FORWARD 50

?FORWARD 1
OUT OF BOUNDS

.he2
Estimating Rotations
.adjust
Since
the student can go no lower than FORWARD 1, s/he realizes that the
TURTLE is now situated at the edge of the screen.  By adding all the
steps that did not result in an OUT OF BOUNDS message (the steps
underlined above), the student concludes that the distance from the
center to the top of the screen is 150 + 50, or 200 TURTLE steps.

.block 5
12.3  Estimating Rotations

0The student develops strategies for estimating the amount of
rotation necessary to aim the TURTLE in a particular direction.
The estimate can be refined by a method involving successive approximations.

.block 6
1EXAMPLES:

2.3.1  Estimating Rotations Less than 90 Degrees

0A student estimates rotations of less than 90 degrees with an
accuracy of + 10 degrees.  Trial and error techniques can be used
to refine the estimate.  A student may want to aim the TURTLE towards the
upper right hand corner of the screen.  S/he might choose to turn the TURTLE RIGHT 50,
knowing that it has to be less than 90 degrees.  By moving the TURTLE
forward, the student can see how accurate the estimate was.

.block 5
12.3.2  Estimating Rotations Greater Than 90 Degrees

0A student estimates rotations of more than 90 degrees by
first turning the TURTLE through a rotation of 90 degrees and then
estimating how much further rotation is necessary.  For example, a student
constructing a right isoceles triangle who has reached the end of the
second equal leg might try the sequence of rotations shown below.
Since it might be difficult for the student to see
when the turtle is aimed in exactly the right direction, these steps
may be combined with some FORWARD commands, in order to see exactly how
close to the correct ending point the TURTLE will come.

correct rotation of 120 degrees may not be apparent to them.

13. The Group Properties of the Number Worlds:  The Structuring of
Mathematical Operations.

.indent 3
2Piaget has demonstrated the significance of the way in which
children develop intellectual structures to deal with mathematical
operations.  The most significant of these operations have been
described by Piaget as "composition" (e.g. the additive property of
numbers) and "inversion" (e.g. formation of the inverse or negative of
an operation).  In the LOGO environment we can observe the development
(or lack of development) of these intellectual structures in the
following ways:

.indent 6
.block 4
-- The use of "composition" is seen in the ways that students combine
or aggregate TURTLE commands so that two commands, FORWARD 50, FORWARD
50, may be combined as FORWARD 100.  Angular rotations can be similarly
aggregated. 

.block 2
--The use of "inversion" is seen in the ways that students are
able to use BACK as an inverse to FORWARD and LEFT as an inverse to RIGHT;

.block 7
--The combination of these operations is seen when students
aggregate a series of commands such as FORWARD 100 BACK 30 FORWARD 10
into one command, FORWARD 80, or a similar series with respect to
rotation, LEFT 90 RIGHT 20 LEFT 10, into LEFT 80 
(It is our finding that that students tend to combine 
these operations more readily with linear numbers than with
angular numbers);

.block 2
--The use of inversion is particularly powerful in projects
involving SPIN commands

.block 2
--The use by students of the particular properties of the
"rotational group" -- its modularity with respect to 360 degrees.

.he2
Failure to Combine Steps
.indent 0
Among our sample of sixteen sixth grade students, we have observed a wide
variety of behaviors with respect to these operations:  from students
who never made use of composition and inversion, to students who use
them inconsistently and tentatively, to students who learned to use them
within certain limited contexts, to students who used them
"automatically" and regularly as part of their LOGO work.  We believe
that this particular set of behaviors provides an unusually good
"window" through which we can view an important aspect of the
children's cognitive development.

Instances of this kind of behavior can often be seen by an examination
of a student's dribble files.  Typically a student's exploratory work
on a project includes many steps which could either be combined at a
later point, or eliminated as unnecessary.  By taking note of just how
readily the student combines or eliminates these steps, and under what
circumstances, we can get a good sense of the student's use of
mathematical operations.

0BEHAVIORS OBSERVED:

13.1  Students Who do Not Make Use of Operations

their work by combining several commands into one.

leg of a right isoceles triangle can be built by a series of FORWARD

13.1.2 The Example of Deborah

0The student who exhibited this type of behavior most
consistently was Deborah.  Although she carried out a number of
projects in Turtle Geometry she was never observed to combine steps.
If she was pleased with an exploration, she always copied all her
original steps exactly as she had first used them.  Thus although she
seemed to understand that two turns of RIGHT 90 and RIGHT 90 were
always needed to "turn the TURTLE around," she never combined these in one
step as RIGHT 180.  Similarly, when she made a mistake, turning LEFT
90, where she needed a right turn, she would correct it by turning
the TURTLE RIGHT 90 to bring it back to its original position, and then
turning it an additional RIGHT 90 to achieve the desired direction.
While this showed a limited ability to use the inverse operation with
regard to angles, it should be noted that Deborah always copied this
series of steps as LEFT 90, RIGHT 90, RIGHT 90, rather than as simply
RIGHT 90.

Students who, like Deborah, had a limited strategy of copying all
experimental steps literally, sometimes had fewer bugs than students who
attempted to combine steps and made arithmetical or copying errors.

.block 5
13.2 Transitional Phase -- Incomplete and Inconsistent Uses of Operations.

0Students usually begin
combining forward
steps before combining rotations
(sometimes a good deal before).
At first, they may
be inconsistent, combining in some cases and not in others.  They begin
the use of inversion by realizing that a forward step can be reversed
by an equal BACK step and that a RIGHT turn can be reversed by an equal
LEFT turn.  It is somewhat later that students are consistently able to
combine FORWARD and BACK steps by subtracting the BACK from the FORWARD
inputs.  Many students never achieve the further step of
combining RIGHTs and LEFTs, by subtracting one from the other.

.block 6
EXAMPLES:

13.2.1  Combining FORWARD Steps but Not Rotational Steps

0An example of partial use of composition is seen in Kevin's
construction of a right isoceles triangle, described above

0A more complex example of inconsistent use of
composition and inversion is shown by Jimmy's first project in which he
drew the BODY of a boat.  First he drew the boat by a series of
exploratory steps, arrived at by a process involving a good deal of
trial and error.  Compare the original steps as written in Jimmy's
notebook with his procedure:

Copying Bugs
.ADJUST
Jimmy made use of both composition and inversion in reducing his
original list of 22 steps to a procedure of 15 steps.  When he used
composition in reducing the group of steps labelled B, RIGHT 92, RIGHT
2, RIGHT 4, to the single step, RIGHT 96, Jimmy made a small
arithmetical error.  When Jimmy combined the steps listed as group A,
he made use of inversion to realize that he could eliminate the steps
PENUP, FORWARD 70, BACK 70, PENDOWN, but he did not combine the 
step, FORWARD 70, with the next step, FORWARD 10.  On the other
hand, he did combine the steps (labeled C), FORWARD 10, FORWARD 4, replacing them
with FORWARD 14.

What Jimmy did with the steps labeled D, RIGHT 89, LEFT 178, is
typical of many students at this stage.  While working, he realized
that he had turned the wrong direction when he typed RIGHT 89.  In his
head he calculated that to compensate for this he would need to turn
LEFT 89 twice, for a total turn of LEFT 178, which he used.  He did not
take the next possible step and replace his two steps by one, LEFT 89.

.block 5 
13.2.3  Dealing With Copying Bugs.

0A common difficulty exhibited by students who are at this
transitional stage is problems with copying combined with faulty
arithmetic.  We have seen an example above, where Jimmy combined RIGHT
92 RIGHT 2 RIGHT 4 as RIGHT 96.  In this case the results were
inconsequential.  Often, however, similar situations have caused rather
confusing bugs.

.he2
Consistent Use of Operations
Laura usually had difficulty predicting whether 
to turn the TURTLE to the right or left.  Once she made a choice, however,
she could easily reverse it.  If she mistakenly typed RIGHT 90, for
example, she would then follow it by typing LEFT 90, LEFT 90.  This
might occur several times within one short project.  When Laura copied
the steps over into her notebook she simplified by writing LEFT 90,
eliminating the "unneeded steps," RIGHT 90, LEFT 90.  Unfortunately, she
often made mistakes in copying, and since she had many opportunities
for such errors, extremely puzzling bugs sometimes occured in her final
procedures.  Since the original steps had been erased from the text
display screen, and since her notebook reflected only her "simplified"
version, she had no easy way of debugging her procedure, other than
starting all over again.

Deborah's approach of copying all steps could have been very useful
to Laura.  Since Laura was conceptually far beyond Deborah and since
Laura was extremely reluctant to do "extra work", she persisted in her
scheme of eliminating "unneccessary" steps as she copied.  This led to
bugs Laura could not understand except
as an inconsistency of the computer.

.block 5
13.3  Consistent Use of Mathematical Operations.

0Some students came to incorporate these operations into their work
quite simply and easily.  Although errors might occassionally be made
in arithmetic or copying, it usually became quite clear when a student
understood these ideas with no difficulty.

.BLOCK 6
EXAMPLES:

13.3.1 0A simple example can be taken from Gary's work.  The following
sequence of statements occured in his dribble file:

.indent 6
.nofill
.BLOCK 4
RIGHT 99
99 + 99
YOU DON'T SAY WHAT TO DO WITH 198
LEFT 198

.indent 0
.adjust
Later, when Gary incorporated this as part of a procedure, he simply
replaced these steps by LEFT 99.  Gary had turned the TURTLE in the
wrong direction and wanted to both undo the wrong turn and make the
correct turn in one combined step.  He used the computer to carry out
the necessary arithmetic and then typed the correct command.  When
copying these steps over, he remembered the process, and without
further ado, used only the correct step, LEFT 99, in his procedure.
Compare this with Jimmy, who kept the two steps RIGHT 89 LEFT 178, as part
of his procedure, or with Laura's regular confusion in copying.

.he2
Using Inversion
.block 5
13.3.2 Sophisticated Uses of Inversion

0An example of a more sophisticated use of inversion is the
process of moving the TURTLE over without changing its orientation.
In this case the LEFT/RIGHT inversion is separated by one or more
intervening steps.
This is necessary when the student wants to repeat a figure two or more
times; for example, three houses could be drawn by
the procedure HOUSES, with its
subprocedures HOUSE and MOVEOVER:

.nofill
.block 23
TO HOUSES	TO MOVEOVER

50 HOUSE	50 PENDOWN
END		END

As part of his STARSHIP project, GARY created two
procedures like MOVEOVER, MO and MOV, each the inverse of the other:

.nofilll

30 LEFT 90	30 RIGHT 90
END		END

.he2
Using Inverse SPIN
.adjust
.block 5
13.4 The Use of Inverse SPINs

0Another example of the use of operations occurs in projects
involving the SPIN command.  SPIN, followed by a number (e.g. SPIN 100)
causes the TURTLE to spin at a fixed rate in the clockwise direction.
Once the TURTLE is spinning it will remain spinning about its original
center of spin.  Any additional non-spin commands will be carried out
so as to maintain the rate of spin of the entire design.  SPIN commands
allow the usual operations of composition and inversion.  Additional
SPIN commands result in increased or decreased rate of spin in an
additive manner.  If the sum of a series of SPINs is negative, the
turtle will spin in a counter clockwise direction.  If the sum is zero
the turtle will stop spinning.  The inverse of a SPIN command is that
same command with a negative input.

To understand how this works, consider the command SPIN 100 FORWARD 100.  This will
cause the turtle to draw a line of length 100, spinning about the
origin.  Any other commands or procedures added at that point will also
be spinning with the original line.

1EXAMPLES:

3.4.1 A Car With Spinning Wheels

0In one of his projects, Dennis drew a car with spinning
wheels.  This meant that he had to make a circle which would spin about
its own center, then return the turtle to the center of the circle and
make it stop spinning so that the (non-spinning) turtle could be moved
over to draw the rest of the car.  His procedure, WHEEL, made use of
inversion with respect to distances, angles and spins:

.nofill
.BLOCK 11

20 PENUP FORWARD 40

His procedure leaves the TURTLE, unmoving, in the center of a spinning
circle.

360o Modularity
13.4.2 0A "ferris wheel" design makes use of
positive and negative SPINs.  After typing SPIN 100, FORWARD 100
the student types SPIN -100.  This leaves the TURTLE facing straight up
at all times (a total spin of zero) while moving around at the end of a
spinning line.  Adding a "car" which hangs vertically makes one arm of
a "ferris wheel".  Adding seven more "cars" each separated by 45
degrees results in a simulation of the motion of a ferris wheel.

13.4.3 A Cowboy's "Lasso"

0Harriet's procedure LASSO,
(described in
detail here in chapter 8 of part III)
required the "undoing" of two SPINs, each spinning about a
different origin.  This required a fairly sophisticated use of
inversion involving combinations of angles, distances and spins,
similar to, but more complex than Dennis's use of inversion in his
WHEEL procedure.

13.5  The use by students of the 360 degree modularity of the
rotational group.

.indent 3
2The group of rotational numbers has a unique property which
distinguishes it from a linear number system -- its modularity with
respect to a "complete rotation" of 360 degrees.  This has some
interesting consequences as far as both composition and inversion are
concerned.  With regard to composition, it has the effect that as
rotations are combined, the total rotation increases until it is 360
degrees.  Beyond 360 degrees, the orientation of the TURTLE is the same
as if it had been turned 360 degrees less.  For example two rotations
of RIGHT 90 turn the TURTLE twice as far as one RIGHT 90. Adding
another RIGHT 90 turns the TURTLE three times a far as one RIGHT 90.
Adding a fourth RIGHT 90 however produces no net effect at all!  A
fifth RIGHT 90 has the same effect as one RIGHT 90, and so on.

With regard to inversion, this modularity means that particular steps
can have more than one inverse.  The inverse of RIGHT 90 is LEFT 90.
It is also RIGHT 270, or LEFT 450.  Two steps that are
conceptually quite different, for example, turning the TURTLE RIGHT
270 and turning the TURTLE LEFT 90, can have exactly the same effect.

One would expect that some students would take a long time to become
aware of these properties, and even longer to make use of them.
Deborah, for instance, was never aware that the same effect could be
obtained by one LEFT 90 as by three RIGHT 90s.  Gary, at the other
extreme, could make use of the equivalence of the two with ease,
whenver it was useful to do so.

TURTLE Coordinates
We will not discuss specific behaviors here, as most of them belong not
to the realm of composition and inversion, as discussed in the section,
but more properly to student use of coordinate systems, discussed in
Section 5, and on student use of theorems and heuristics, discussed in
section 6 below.

2When we discuss the use of Turtle Coordinates, we mean the
understanding that the specific consequences of one particular TURTLE
action, dependent on a specific position and heading, can be used to
predict a more distant effect, achieved by a sequence of such actions.
This involves the extrapolation of an immediate effect, into a global
consequence, and is an important example of mathematical reasoning.  The
most common examples of this are the construction of a "LOGO circle,"
changing the rate of curvature of a circle, and the extensions of a
circle -- the POLY and POLYSPI procedures.  These activities can help a
student develop an intuitive feeling for differential geometry, laying
the foundation for an entirely new computational approach to the

4.1  The Construction of a "LOGO circle." 

.indent 3
2Many students who have been introduced to the LOGO TURTLE, and to
its basic commands (FORWARD, BACK, RIGHT and LEFT) find themselves
asking, "Can the TURTLE draw a circle?"

A teacher's response to this is usually to suggest that the student
"play turtle:"  get
up and walk in a circle, and try to make a description of what s/he is
doing.  Some students spontaneously describe their behaviors as "keep
going forward a little and turning a little."  These students may then
be able to immediately translate this description to a series of turtle
commands: FORWARD 1, RIGHT 1, FORWARD 1, RIGHT 1, ... or FORWARD 5,
RIGHT 5, FORWARD 5, RIGHT 5, ...  Repeating such a series of commands,
360 and 72 times, respectively, will produce a many sided polygon that
is visually indistinguishable from a circle.

Constructing a "LOGO Circle"
.page
.adjust
Other students have more difficulty separating the "forward" and "turn"
aspects of walking in a circle.  This may be because they move forward
and turn at the same time when they walk in a circle.  If the teacher
reminds the student that s/he has to try to "be the TURTLE" which can
only "do one thing at a time," the student is usually able to recognize
that forward and turn have to be used alternatively by the TURTLE.
Some students still do not realize that the inputs to FORWARD and RIGHT
must be uniform, in order to achieve a circle.  Often some direct
experimentation with the screen TURTLE is necessary before students
realize that the TURTLE steps that are repeated must be small and
uniform, in order to produce a circle.

For many students, their work in drawing a LOGO circle is also their
first contact with writing "patterned" procedures -- procedures that
make use of a REPEAT command, looping or recursion.  Learnings in this
area are described in Chapter 4, Section 6 of this report.

14.1.1  Circles of Different Curvature

0Most students draw their first circle by using the same input
for both FORWARD and RIGHT commands.  It is not until they wish to
vary the size of the circle, that students begin to realize that the
forward and turn inputs can be different and still produce a circle.
Typically, a student will try to increase the size of a circle by
increasing both inputs the same amount.
Surprisingly, FORWARD 2, RIGHT 2... FORWARD 1,
RIGHT 1, and even FORWARD 10, RIGHT 10, draw almost identical circles.

.CE

It is only when a student can separate the effects of the FORWARD and
RIGHT commands that s/he can change the size of the circle.

Darlene's first successful circle used different inputs for FORWARD
and RIGHT:  RIGHT 2, FORWARD 3, ...  When she wanted to make a
smaller circle she tried reducing the inputs to RIGHT 1, FORWARD 2.
This drew a larger circle.  She then tried RIGHT 3, FORWARD 2,
which was smaller than her original.  Her next circle was RIGHT 3,
FORWARD 3, which was larger than the previous one, but smaller than her
first circle.  RIGHT 4, FORWARD 2, produced the smallest circle of all.
In this way Darlene was gradually able to control the curvature of her
circles.

POLY procedures
allow a student to construct many different shapes making use of
repetition of a fixed distance and turn.  This allows the student to
experiment more easily with the global effects of local changes and to
experience the effects of changing "curvature".
Aspects of student work with POLY procedures are also discussed in
Sections 1, 3.5, and 6.4 of this chapter,
and in Section 6 of chapter 4,
which describes student
behaviors in learning to write "patterned" procedures.

.block 5
14.3  Extensions of POLY

0Procedures which increment the distance or angle variables in a POLY
procedure, provide a further opportunity for investigation of the
global effects of local actions.  Consider the effects of a procedure

the FORWARD step increases or decreases uniformly.  This is similar to

take into acount the TURTLE's position and heading in order to
accomplish even the simplest tasks.  Through their work on specific
projects, they come to make use of -- sometimes even invent -- global
structures of their own. They can use these structures to solve problems that
require that they take into account aspects of geometry other than the
turtle's immediate position and heading.  In this section we describe
student behaviors that relate to structures that can be used to organize

2The project could be carried out without any use of coordinate systems,
by simply moving the turtle to each location where a circle is to be
drawn, and using the command RCIRCLE, with the appropriate input to
draw circles of different radii.  Without some advance planning,
however, the result is likely to lack the symmetry of the original

move around the figure itself, as part of the process of constructing
it.  In order to use intrinsic coordinates for this project, a student
would require an arc procedure, ARCR :RADIUS :ANGLE, whose two inputs
determine the radius and the angle of the arc.  This procedure allows
the TURTLE to move from point to point along a particular circle,
rather than to try to move the TURTLE directly to the desired point.
In figure 5.4, the command 0ARCR 100 1202 allows the TURTLE to move along

5.2.1 Kevin's Intrinsic "Arc Coordinates"

0Kevin's major project was to draw a picture of a "turtle" on the
graphics display screen.  He was shown an arc procedure which allowed
both radius and angle as inputs.  The circle procedure that he used to
draw the outline of the "turtle's" shell made use of 10 degree steps,
and had a radius of 90.  At the end of each step, a tiny dot appeared
on the screen.  Kevin could manouever the TURTLE along the "turtle's"
shell, by counting dots, and using the appropriate input to ARCR.  For
example, after drawing the "turtle's" head, Kevin wanted to place four
feet and a tail on the "turtle's" shell.   He simpy oriented the
TURTLE along the shell, counted three dots between where the TURTLE was,

15.2.2 The "Hat" on Donald's "Head"

0Donald's extended project was to have the computer draw a complex
head, complete with beard, hair, hat and flower:
At one point, he had to figure out where to locate the "hat" on the
head, and how large to make it, so that it would appear symmetrical.
Since Donald had difficulty estimating sizes, and solving problems
visually (see a summary of Donald's work in section chapter 5 of this
report, and a full profile in section @@@@ of part II), he often
resorted to "analytical" strategies to help solve his problem.  In this
case he made use of the "hairs" which he had already drawn as part of
his head.  By counting hairs, from each side of the head, he was able
to determine when the hat was sufficiently symmetrical to satisfy him
(he didn't get it "perfectly" centered).  A drawing in his notebook was
used as part of the process.

15.3 Student Use of Cartesian Coordinates

.indent 3
2The cartesian coordinate system is the most commonly used global
geometric structure in most courses on analytic geometry, trigonometry, calculus,
etc.  In LOGO activities, cartesian coordinates have a more limited
applicability, because of the compelling immediacy of local Turtle
Coordinates as a way of solving the simplest geometric problems which
arise in Turtle Geometry.  The cartesian description of a circle, for
example, x2 + y2 = r2, requires the user to understand
algebra, the use of exponents, and possibly the pythagorean theorem.
It specifies the radius of the circle, and gives a formula enabling the
user to find any number of points on the circle, relative to the
center.  The LOGO description, FORWARD 1, RIGHT 1, ... on the other
hand, tells exactly how to draw the circle, without specifying how large
it is, or where the center is, or where any particular point is located.

LOGO is designed to simplify the use of
cartesian coordinates for specific
applications.  Every point on the display screen is considered to have
an x-and-y-coordinate.  The LOGO comands XCOR and YCOR output the 
x-and-y-coordinates of wherever the TURTLE happens to be.  SETXY is a
command requiring two inputs, will move the TURTLE directly to the
point on the screen which has the x-and-y-coordinates given.  To
totally specify a TURTLE position, it's orientation or "heading" must also be given.
The LOGO commands HEADING and SETHEADING are analagous to XCOR, YCOR
and SETXY.

The LOGO command HERE outputs a list of three numbers, the x, y and
heading coordinates of the turtle.  The command, HERE, allows a user to
give a name to a point on the screen, by moving the TURTLE to that
point and using the MAKE comand, as in MAKE "POINT1 HERE.  To return
the TURTLE to that point later the user types SETTURTLE :POINT1.
Points on the screen can also be named without moving the TURTLE as in
the command MAKE "POINT2 [100 100 0].  "POINT2 then represents a TURTLE
position whose x-coordinate and y-coordinate are both 100, and whose
orientation is straight up on the screen.

.he2
Using an Implicit Grid
Many students who do not use cartesian coordinates explicitly do make
use of a sort of implicit grid system, in moving the turtle from one
place to another on the display screen.  Students are often introduced
to the coordinates in a situation in which the naming of a specific
point, and the later return of the TURTLE to that point are needed for
a particular project.  Cartesian coordinates may also be encountered in
a situation in which the user wants to know whether the TURTLE is
inside or outside of a particular region of the screen (as in an
animated "race" or a "target game.")  Another use of cartesian
coordinates occurs when the student wants the TURTLE to draw a grid on
the screen -- for example, to draw a tictatoe board.0

1EXAMPLES:

5.3.1  The Use of an "Implicit Grid" In Moving the TURTLE

0Many students find it easier to move the turtle around the display
screeen in horizontal and vertical "steps", than to accurately estimate
both the distance and direction of a point to which the turtle is to be
moved.  To move the TURTLE to one corner of the screen, for example,
many students spontaneously learn to use this 
set of commands:  RIGHT 90, FORWARD 200, LEFT
90, FORWARD 200 (rather than RIGHT 45, FORWARD 282, which would move the
TURTLE directly to the same spot.)

.block 17
.sp 15
.spread
/Figure 5.28//Figure 5.29


.he2
Naming Points
Albert used this approach for almost all TURTLE
moves (other than drawing curves or triangles).  Using a series of
alternating FORWARD and RIGHT 90 or LEFT 90 commands, he could move the
TURTLE anywhere on the screen.  His inputs to FORWARD usually started
with multiples of 50 or 100, which "fit" nicely into the total screen
size of 400 TURTLE steps.  

A student who uses this approach is not using "coordinates", but is in
a sense "drawing a mental grid," creating a structure in the mind which
will later make a grid-like cartesian coordinate system seem quite natural.

.block 6
15.3.2  Naming Points Without Coordinates

0Let us consider a few different ways that a student might make use of
the capability to name point and set the turtle to that point in the
context of a particular project, a target game.  The idea is that a
target is drawn on the screen.  The turtle is then placed at the center
of the screen (or another point), aimed at the target, using RIGHT and
LEFT commands, and then "shot" at the target.  The computer has to tell
the player if the target has been hit.

First, the student might use point naming to draw a state transparent
circle that starts from the center of the circle:
.nofill

.indent 6
.block 8
TO TARGET
10 MAKE "P1 HERE
20 PENUP FORWARD 40
30 PENDOWN RIGHT 90
40 RCIRCLE 40
50 PENUP SETTURTLE :P1
END

.indent 0
.adjust
The student must now draw the target at a particular point on the
screen.  The TURTLE is first driven to the desired point, and the point
given a name, say "P2.  To set up the target for a game, the student
can make a procedure.

.nofill
.indent 6
.BLOCK 5

10 PENUP SETTURTLE :P2
20 TARGET

.indent 0

In a game, the TURTLE is aimed at the target, and fired by a procedure
called SHOOT, which checks to see whether the TURTLE has hit the target.

.indent 6

between the TURTLE and any point, and which could be given to the student as

15.3.3 Naming Points With Coordinates.

0Involvement in a project such as the target game described above
leads quite naturally to the desire to select many different points for
the location of the target, and for the initial position of the TURTLE
before shooting.  After gaining some experience with points by using
MAKE "POINT HERE, the student can acquire some experience with the coordinates
themselves by typing PRINT HERE.  S/he will then see that the computer keeps track
of the TURTLE's location by means of a list of three numbers
corresponding to its x and y coordinates and its heading.  Instead of
moving the TURTLE to a particular point, "P2, in order to define it, the student
can define it by giving its coordinates, MAKE "P2 [50 50 45];  or by having the 
computer choose coordinates for the point in a random way:

MAKE "P2 (SENTENCE 10*RANDOM 10*RANDOM 20*RANDOM)

15.3.4 Constructing a Grid Using Cartesian Coordinates

for example, using x and y coordinates, and the command SETXY:

15.4 The Use of Polar Coordinates

.indent 3
2In a polar coordinate system
any point is located by
specifying its distance from a fixed origin and its angle of
orientation with respect to a fixed line through the origin.  To use
the TURTLE with a polar coordinate system, one can set the orientation of the
TURTLE to the desired heading with respect to the vertical, and move
it forward the desired distance.  Polar coordinates can be
useful in LOGO projects in which the TURTLE always returns to a fixed
point, but changes its orientation, to carry out a sequence of actions.

Students who make use of this kind of approach as part of a LOGO
project, do not consider it a formal coordinate system.  For them, a
structure based on the TURTLE's orientation can be thought of
as another form of "intrinsic" or "implicit" coordinate system,
a "trick" developed for its usefulness in a particular case.  
Students who make use of this particular approach develop an
intuitive understanding that may later help them understand a more
formal use of polar coordinates.

15.4.2 Angular Coordinates With Spinning Designs

0Many students create spinning designs which end with a HOME command,
to complete the design and "undo" the spin.  Karl called his design,
NO.  A "flower-like" design he made by repeating NO, was called XX78055.

.adjust
If NO had not contained a HOME command, Karl's
XX78055 procedure would have been of the shape, rotation, shape,
rotation... type of design, and would not have involved polar
coordinates.  Since NO ends with a HOME comand, the TURTLE ends up at
the origin, in a vertical orientation every time NO is executed.
Therefore, the TURTLE's rotation had to be increased before each
successive NO, in order to produce the design Karl wanted.

16. Theorems and Heuristics:  Towards Formal Mathematics

.indent 3
2In formal mathematics classes, students are generally
taught that a
"theorem" is a mathematical proposition, already known to be "true"
that has to be "proven" by a series of logical statements based on axioms
and previously proven theorems.  
The task of a working
mathematician, on the other hand, is to formulate propositions, to try to discover the
predictable regularities of a particular "world";  then to test, extend
and revise or discard such propositions based on the tests; and only
finally, after a theorem and its usefulness is quite well established,
to attempt to prove or disprove it in a logical sense.

Students learning LOGO have the opportunity to function like a
mathematician, rather than like a student in a mathematics class.*

While solving their own problems, students begin to discover some of
the regularities of the mathematical world in which they are
functioning.  Such regularities may be used by the students as
"heuristics" -- strategies or "rules of thumb" that may be helpful in
problem solving.  Heuristics used by LOGO students include general
approaches to problem solving, such as breaking a large problem in
small easily solved parts, specific techniques such as "playing TURTLE"
to understand which way to move the TURTLE in a specific instance or to
plan a shape like a circle, and specific geometric design ideas such as
"keep repeating a shape and an interesting design will occur."

When a student who has discovered and used a heuristic such as "repeat
a shape" begins to be aware of certain regularities that occur whenever
that heuristic is applied, s/he is on the track of a "theorem".  For
instance, the student may realize that "all repeated designs eventually
close;"  that is, the TURTLE begins to retrace its path,
if a sequence of steps repeated
often enough.  Some students become extremely interested in verifying
such a proposition.  Although the formal "proof" of
such a proposition is beyond the interest or ability of an elementary
school student, it might be an interesting math project for a high
school or college student studying LOGO.**

A "Repetition Theorem"
.page
If the student shows further interest in
this idea, s/he may begin to compare specific shapes with the number of
repeats required before they close.  Such an investigation could lead
to another theorem:  "any time the TURTLE has completed a series of
steps and returned to its exact starting position and heading, it has
rotated through 360 degrees, or an integer multiple of 360 degrees."
This is such a common and useful LOGO theorem that it has been given a
name, the "Total Turtle Trip"  theorem, or "TTT" for short.  The TTT
applies to situations that do not involve repetition, but it is most commonly
discovered, and used in cases that do involve repetition of a series of
fixed steps.

In this section, we describe student behaviors involving theorems and
heuristics that arise in the context of Turtle Geometry.  Many of these
relate in some way to the properties of the rotational group, described
in Section 3.  Theorems and heuristics we will consider in some detail
include repetition;  the Total Turtle Trip theorem and a special case,
the POLY theorem; the concept of similarity; and the use of symmetry.

0Many students develop a process of repeating a shape and a
rotation.  If a procedure is "state transparent" -- that is, the TURTLE
returns to its original position and heading when it completes the
figure -- then repeating it causes it to retrace itself.
One way to make a more complex design with such a shape is to rotate the TURTLE
a fixed amount after each repetition of the shape.  
Monica  used this approach with many of her basic shapes.  Here are
some of the designs Monica made, using her state-transparent TRI

0Some students quickly realize that when repeating "shape, rotation,"
that certain "special angles" produce fairly simple closed figures,
while other angles produce complex figures which take a long time to
close, or which "fill up the screen" before closing.  Focussing on the
particular angles which make the simpler shapes can be an important
step, leading to understanding the significance of 360 degrees and to
the TTT theorem.  A particular case of this is the

something, RIGHT something a certain number of times.

0Darlene had a systematic approach to problems that she encountered.

she experimentally determined exactly how many repeats were required.
With careful observation she found that the command REPEAT [RIGHT 2

realized that the TURTLE had turned exactly 360 degrees as it drew the
circle she was able to draw smaller circles by using the commands:

16.3.2  Constructing an Equilateral Triangle, and Other Regular
Polygons. 

.indent 3
2Once a student has drawn a square using the turtle, it is natural to
attempt the construction of a triangle.  There are many ways to
construct a triangle using trial and error approaches.  Some of these
have been discussed above.  Another approach is to make use of
information derived from the process of constructing a square and apply
it to constructing a triangle.  The reasoning involved is far from
trivial, and it is often the case that a student and a teacher will
work together on this process, rather than a student figuring it
all out independently.

The reasoning goes like this.  A square is constructed by repeating the
same "thing" four times.  The "thing" that is repeated is the pair of
steps, FORWARD something, RIGHT 90.  In doing so, the TURTLE has rotated a
total of 360 degrees.  The student also knows that a rotation of 360
degrees will turn the TURTLE all the way around.  In order to draw a
triangle, the TURTLE will also make a shape in which it turns all the
way around, this time in three steps.  The amount of rotation
needed for each step is thus 360/3 or 120 degrees.  The student 
can now draw a triangle by
repeating FORWARD something, RIGHT 120 three times.  

At this point, the student might explore the generality of this
approach by trying to construct a 6, 8 or 10 sided regular polygon.  In
each case, the process as described above will lead to a successful result.
(The process breaks down if the student wants to construct a 7 sided
polygon, however, since 360 is not evenly divisible by 7.)

0A common student project is to draw a "leaf" for a plant, using
quarter arcs:

.sp 6
.ce
Figure 6.16

The student knows that the RARC and LARC procedures cause the TURTLE to
rotate a total of 90 degrees.  In order to draw a "leaf" and return to the point
at which it started (which is useful in getting the TURTLE back on the
plant's "stem") the student reasons that the TURTLE must draw an arc,
turn some amount, draw another arc and turn the same amount.  Since the
two arcs cause the turtle to rotate a total of 180 degrees, the TURTLE
needs to turn a total of (360-180), or 180 degrees at both ends of the
leaf.  Thus the TURTLE must turn 90 degrees at each end of the leaf.
This procedure will draw the leaf:

16.4 Calculating the Number of Points in a Star or Polygon, Using a

2Another way of approaching the "total turtle trip" is by analysing
the results of using different inputs for POLY.  (See section 2)  A
student might be asked by a teacher to keep a chart showing the angle
input for poly, the number of points in the resulting star or polygon,
and the calculated total rotation turned by the turtle in completing
the design.  A student who has carefully carried out a number of POLY
experiments will find that for any polygon, the turtle will turn
through total rotation of 360 degrees, and that for any star, the
turtle will turn through a total rotation of a multiple of 360 degrees.
(A five pointed star, produced with an angle input of 144 degrees turns
the turtle a total of 720 degrees.  An eight pointed star, produced
with an angle of 135 degrees turns the turtle through a total of 1080
degrees, etc.)  This is a more generalized form of the Total
Turtle Trip Theorem.

a "LOGO Similarity Theorem".  A proportional change in all the FORWARD
and BACK steps in a sequence of TURTLE commands, while holding the
angles constant, will change the size, but maintain the shape of the
figure drawn by those commands.  While few students come to understand
this principle in its full generality, there are many ways in which
students encounter it in simpler forms and use it in their LOGO
projects.  The desire to create similar designs often provides students
with their first use of variables, as they try to create "different
sized squares," for example.

6.5.1  Similarity In Regular Shapes.

0Almost every student encounters regular similar shapes when they
work with RCIRCLE and LCIRCLE commands, squares of different sizes, and
the shapes made by a POLY procedure.  Since all the sides of a regular
shape are the same, making the length of that side a variable, rather
than a fixed distance leads immediately to similar figures.

16.6 The Use of Symmetry

.indent 3
2The idea of symmetry is one which most students encounter as part of
their LOGO experience.  A "LOGO symmetry theorem" might be stated as
follows:  "If all the right and left commands in a sequence of TURTLE
commands are reversed, without changing any of the other commands in
the sequence, the resulting design will be a mirror image of the
original design."  The reversing of RIGHT and LEFT, is
one approach which students use to create symmetrical designs.  Another
is the use of an "implied axis of symmetry," usually a vertical line
down the center of a design, in which both sides are identical but in
which the symmetry is produced by "working across from one side" of the
design rather than by starting from the middle and reversing RIGHT and
LEFT commands.  Some students make use of one of these approaches to
symmetry in connection with a design that is not fully symmetrical, or
in a design that is mostly symmetrical, but which has one or two
dramatic asymmetries.  Finally, many students carry out projects
involving rotational symmetry, many examples of which have been considered above.

Right/Left Reversal
.block 6
1EXAMPLES:

6.6.1 Symmetry by Right/Left Reversal

0Symmetry by right/left reversal is usually preceded by the
realization that a RIGHT turn can be eliminated by an equal LEFT turn,
and reversed by a double LEFT turn.  This involves the use of right and
left as inverses of each other, and was discussed in Section 4 of this
chapter.  The most common example of designs which make use of
right/left reversal are those made by using arc and circle primitives,
RARC, LARC, RCIRCLE and LCIRCLE, since these immediately produce
symmetrical designs.  

Two simple examples of this type of symmetry were Deborah's procedure
called EYES,
drawn using RCIRCLE and LCIRCLE, and the NOSE procedure she used
for her "rabbit" in which she used RARC and LARC as inverses of
each other.

Implied Axis of Symmetry
Gary regularly made use of the "LOGO symmetry theorem" in his work.  An
example discussed fully in Section 5.5 of chapter 4, was his

entire process.

16.6.2 Projects Involving an Implied Axis of Symmetry0

Many students created symmetrical designs without reversing right and
left commands.  Such a design is likely to be a drawing of a face, a
rocket, a house, etc.  Such designs may also have one or two dramatic
asymmetric features.

When Kathy added a hat on her BIRDMAN design (Figure 6.26), she made
use of an implicit axis of symmetry.

.block 7

Figure 6.28

Gary's first major project was a FACE which looks as though it was
constructed using right/left symmetry.  Actually Gary used a more
elaborate approach which involved estimating the sizes of circles and
placing the TURTLE so that it could draw the circles starting from the outside.
The "Nose" is the only asymmetric feature.

Donald's HEAD was also worked out without the use of right/left
symmetry.  Although his symmetrical placement of the "hat" was not
exact, it was clearly intended to be so.  Once again the "nose" is
deliberately asymmetic, as is the flower.

As a final example of student use of symmetry we examine Kathy's
procedure MONSTER.  MONSTER was produced by an exploration involving
arcs and circles.  When Kathy divided this into subprocedures MO, NS,
and TER, MO and NS were symmetrical, while MO and TER were identical.
Although Kathy probably used a symmetric process in working out her
design, the asymmetry of the design as a whole obscured this aspect of
it.
