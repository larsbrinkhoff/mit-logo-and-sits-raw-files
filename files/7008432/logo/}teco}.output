115. Ray

0Ray is a student who has been diagnosed by school personnel as
having "learning disabilities".  He is tutored individually by a
learning disabilities specialist several times each week.  His teachers
feel that at the beginning of the year he was noticeably "slipping" in
his seriousness as a student.  (His 6th grade achievement test placed
him in the 24th percentile, nationally.)

Although Ray was initially quite successful in controlling the motion
of the TURTLE, he held himself somewhat aloof from the activities in
the LOGO classes.  As a result, he never succeeded in writing a
procedure without assistance, although he had considerable success
(with help) on several projects such as drawing and animating a rocket
(sessions 13-15) and in using the computer with procedures that enabled
him to explore geometric shapes.  In general, Ray had success using the
computer in two kinds of situations:  when a teacher was helping him
intensely during a session, and when he was working in a way that
required him to remember only one variable at a time.

The teaching strategy for Ray was to try to structure situations in
which he could be successful without a lot of hel from the teacher,
since Ray would usually "forget" what to do when the teacher was no
longer present.  For the longest time, Ray did not engage in much "free
experimentation" with the TURTLE.  But towards the end of the series of
classes (session 19) he was given a POLY procedure which requires two
inputs to produce a series of closed geometric shapes, and a SPIRAL
procedure which required three inputs and produced a variety of spiral
shapes.  Ray gradually learned how to control the inputs to produce
certain shapes in a predictable way.  For the first time, he began to
experiment in a purposeful way, to write things down in his notebook,
to use those notes to remember successful designs.  He began to gain
confidence in his ability to control the computer.  He invited a friend
to class -- together they had a very exciting time exploring the shapes
produced by the POLY and SPI procedures.  Ray's teachers also reported
a noticeable improvement in his attitude in class, which they
attributed partly to his feeling of success in the LOGO classroom.

11. Ray's Working Style

0From the first day he came to class, in session 2, Ray insisted on remaining "aloof"; preventing himself from feeling personally involved with the LOGO activities.  Although he started off quite successfully, and actually was generally successful under close supervision in his first programming project -- causing the computer to draw his initials -- he maintained his "cool" until the last four or five sessions, when he began to allow himself to become interested in what he was doing.

Before summarizing his work, it would be useful to list some of his techniques for maintaining and reinforcing his posture of aloofness from the activities.  He began by coming four or five minutes late for each class.  By coming to class late,
he could be sure that the teacher 
would be already working with another student.  
Then he could wait several more minutes
for the teacher to remind him how to LOGIN, and start 
him with a suggestion for his day's work.  He often walked into class whistling loudly, blatantly disregarding anything else that was going on.  He made a point of always leaving a few minutes early, and as he worked on activities, he would look at the clock, to see if it was time to leave yet.

Ray also made a point of not remembering how to do things.  He would not write things down in his notebook, and when asked to consult a reference sheet or an entry in his notebook, he would usually just sit, and wait for help.
This was his way of reinforcing a sense of helplessness, of "I can't do it", of dependency on the teacher.  Rather than maximizing his use of available resources, Ray deliberately minimized them.

Ray refused to learn the details of operation of the system and the language.  Not until class 12 did he LOGIN by himself.  He never wrote a file without assistance.  Likewise, he never wrote a procedure without help.  Although he was introduced to the REPEAT command, and used it to 
make TURTLE designs that were quite pleasing to him, he never remembered the format for using it, and would not look it up.

We are using words like "refused to learn", "techniques for maintaining..aloofness," "made 
a point of not remembering," because we are convinced that these 
were definite strategies Ray used, to protect himself from involvement, rather than 
a "sincere" inability to concentrate or learn.

At the same time, Ray is clearly intelligent, attractive and charming.  He has a definite natural aptitude for music -- he enjoyed spending time tapping rhythmically, whistling, and improvising intuitively on the piano.

Ray appears to have a strong fear
of failure, and especially of appearing to fail.  His strategy for coping with this has been the "class clown" approach -- act a little bit silly, charm everyone, and above all, don't let anyone know you're trying. 
Our teaching strategy with Ray was to try to structure situations so that he would be successful, and develop a sense of confidence -- a sense that he could do it.  
This was done
both by setting up
a special animation project for him, (which in the end 
required too much teacher help) and by 
trying to set up situations in which he could be sucessful with very little input.  The latter approach proved to be the best for Ray, as
will be seen from
the detailed description of his work.

12. Ray's Work in Turtle Geometry

0Despite his difficulties, Ray was interested in the computer, and its power.  He showed a good deal of "natural ability" in Turtle Geometry.
Ray was very successful in directing the TURTLE, estimating quickly and accurately, both angles and distances.  His first project was making his initials, and he carried it out quite successfully, combining skill in Turtle Geometry with a quick 
understanding of using the keyboard, and an understanding of how to write procedures.

As Ray went on beyond this project, however, 
there appeared to be many difficulties impeding his progress.  
He would rarely work purposefully unless the teacher was present.  
All his further Turtle Geometry explorations appeared to be random.  He did not remember how to write a procedure, and refused to "look it up", in his notebook.  
He was shown
how to make a procedure out of two or three TURTLE steps, and 
the use REPEAT to make designs.  He made several simple designs -- SAM, TIM and JOE.  
Still, he did not remember from time to 
time, how to make a procedure, or how to use the REPEAT command.  Again, he refused to look it up in his notebook.

After completing his initials project
Ray's work for the next seven classes
was characterized by short bursts of activity -- especially when 
the teacher was present -- and frequent visits to the water fountain, and to 
the piano in the next room.  Ray was absent for four of the first
eleven classes.
What Ray did do successfully on his own was to 
experiment with different inputs to REPEAT.  He would use sequences like REPEAT
[SAM] 90, REPEAT [TIM] 30, REPEAT [JOE] 20, REPEAT [SAM] 30, etc. (See figure 15.2)

After doing some of these, he'd return to ones he liked.  It seemed that he could focus for a short time on the task of choosing inputs to REPEAT, although he could not remember how to use REPEAT from class to class.  By class 12, however, this approach had lost interest for Ray, and it became clear that it had not resulted in his being able to write procedures independently, as I had hoped.

In session 13, I suggested an animation project to Ray.  He agreed, and decided to animate a rocket.  Session 13 was spent drawing the rocket.  I spent a major part of the period working with him, first helping him figure out how to draw a triangle (see fig. R-3), and then helping him organize the task of teaching his rocket to the computer.  His ROCKET procedure had two subprocedures, TOP (triangle) and ROCK (rectangle). (See figure R-3)

In class 14, I again worked closely with Ray.  We worked through the process of animating the rocket.  He decided that his ROCKET was too big, so I helped him make a smaller, scaled down version, which he decided to call FB.  His procedure to move the rocket was called NKP.  I introduced Ray to the idea of SNAPs.  He understood how they were used to animate the motion -- but of course he had difficulty remembering the format for using SNAPs.  I had the distinct sensation that I had introduced too much material during this class.

In class 15, I again spent a great deal of time with Ray.  He was not especially interested in varying the WAIT and Distance for the animation (I had given him a procedure which he could use to do that easily), but he was interested in making the rocket turn.  I printed out his animation procedure NKP, and we figured out together where he could put a turn command, to make the rocket turn on the screen.  While still in edit mode, Ray experimented on his own with different inputs for the turn:  RT 300, RT 66, RT 2, RT 3, etc.  He finally settled on RT 9, as the largest number he could use without having his rocket go off the screen.  He then typed END, followed by GOODBYE (without a WRITE command).

It was in analyzing the dribble file from this class that I became strongly aware that Ray had been consistently successful in activities that required varying only one paramter at a time.  I began serious consideration of how to use this observation to get Ray involved in a more consistent relationship with his work.

Class 16 was spent in a whole class discussion about the story "ZEEP and the paint".  Ray was determinedly aloof.  Ray spent class 17 working with Jeanne on the pattern block task, and at the piano.  Class 18 was mostly wasted.  I tried to get Ray to use recursion, but he said "I don't like designs."  I also tried to start him on another turtle geometry project, but when I went to spend time with another student, that too fell flat.

It was decided to introduce Ray to the LOGO music box, during the following week, to try to capitalize on his interest in musical improvisation, and to give Ray a special sphere of activity, in which his work would not be compared with anyone else's.  This did not work out because of breakdowns in the MIT LOGO system, to which the music box was to be connected, via remote terminal.

In class 19,  I decided to just give Ray a POLY procedure, with a simple stop rule, and let him experiment with changing the inputs.  In this way, he would have only one thing to consider -- the choice of numbers to make interesting designs.  This was a successful choice and he continued to work with POLYs and a POLYSPI type procedure for the next six classes.

In working with POLY during classes 19 and 20, Ray tended to choose inputs based on "number patterns" rather than on the effects produced by the POLY procedure itself.  For example, during class 19, the POLY inputs he chose were (see Figure R-4):

In class 20 I made a point of showing him that the first number effects the size, and the second number the shape.  His work was still based on number patterns.

In class 21 I showed Ray a spiral procedure, SPI:SIDE:ANGLE, and later edited it to make the increment a variable as well, SPI:SIDE:ANGLE:GROW.  For the first time, Ray began to experiment with the effect of the changed input, by varying the rate of growth of the spiral.  First Ray experimented with small numbers like SPI 1 1 and SPI 3 4.  Even with inputs like SPI 22 33, Ray found the shapes "boring", because they all went off the screen so fast.  I suggested larger numbers for the second input, and Ray tried things like 1 100, 2 200, 3 300, and 4 400.  I showed him the relationship between POLY and SPI by putting POLY 100, 200, and SPI 2 200, on the screen one after the other. (See figure, R-5)

.block 18
.sp 16

Ray was a lot more interested now, but he still felt that they went off the screen too quickly.  I edited SPI to allow changes in the increment, adding the variable GROW, and I showed Ray how to use it.

Ray liked the effect of the tighter spirals -- especially the emergent designs, which became apparent with small increments.  He tried 1 400 1, 1 400 3, 1 401 1, focussing now on the effect of changing the numbers, rather than on the numbers themselves.

.epage 1
Ray came in with his idea for class 22: "Can I put SPI and POLY together?" (I told him he could if he used the POLY first.)  I had also made up a worksheet for him which listed a few POLY and SPI designs, and left space for him to write down some "interesting" numbers of his own choosing.  He worked with these activities for a solid hour, asking for help at only two points, writing down several "good numbers" on the chart I had given him.  He liked one of the designs a lot, SPI 10, 150, 2, and called people over to see it.  At the end of the class he spontaneously punched holes in his papers and put them carefully in his notebook.  Today Ray's explorations were much more systematic:  changing only one variable at a time.

In session 23, I gave Ray another procedure, LPOLY, with which he could make symmetrical shapes.  After using this a while, he went back to SPIs.  This time, focussing on the emergent spirals.  He had drawn SPI 1 250
